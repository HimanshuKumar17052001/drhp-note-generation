Any reliance by persons not\nfamiliar with Indian accounting policies and practices on the financial disclosures presented in this Draft Red\nHerring Prospectus should, accordingly, be limited. There are significant differences between Ind AS, Indian\nGAAP, U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Our Company does not provide reconciliation of its financial information to IFRS\nor U.S. GAAP. Our Company has not attempted to explain those differences or quantify their impact on the\nfinancial data included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus and it is urged that you consult your own advisors\nregarding such differences and their impact on our financial data. For details, see “Risk Factors – Indian\naccounting standard (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles, such as international financial reporting\nstandards (“IFRS”) and United States generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”) have significant\ndifferences, which may be material to investors’ assessments of our financial condition” on page 81.\nAll the figures in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus have been presented in million or in whole numbers where\nthe numbers have been too small to present in million unless stated otherwise. One million represents 1,000,000\nand one billion represents 1,000,000,000. Certain figures contained in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus,\nincluding financial information, have been subject to rounding adjustments. Certain figures in decimals have been\nrounded off to the two decimal points. Any discrepancies in any table between the totals and the sum of the\namounts listed are due to rounding off. In certain instances, (i) the sum or percentage change of numbers may not\nconform exactly to the total figure given, and (ii) the sum of the figures in a column or row in certain tables may\nnot conform exactly to the total figure given for that column or row. Figures sourced from third-party industry\nsources may be expressed in denominations other than million or may be rounded off to other than two decimal\npoints in the respective sources, and such figures have been expressed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus in\nsuch denominations or rounded-off to such number of decimal points as provided in such respective sources\nUnless the context otherwise indicates, any percentage amounts, as set forth in “Risk Factors”, “Our Business”\nand “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on pages 36,\n225 and 396, respectively, and elsewhere in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus have been calculated on the basis\nof amounts derived from the Restated Financial Information.\nNon-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Financial Measures\nThis Draft Red Herring Prospectus contains certain non-GAAP financial measures and certain other statistical\ninformation relating to our operations and financial performance like Adjusted Gross Margin, EBITDA, EBITDA\nMargin, Profit / (Loss) for the year Margin and certain other supplemental statistical information relating to our\noperations and financial performance (together, “Non-GAAP Measures”) that are not required by, or presented\nin accordance with, Ind AS, Indian GAAP, or IFRS. Further, these non-GAAP measures are not a measurement\nof our financial performance or liquidity under Ind AS, Indian GAAP, IFRS or U.S. GAAP and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or construed as an alternative to profit/ (loss) for the years, cash flows, liquidity or any\nother measure of financial performance or as an indicator of our operating performance, liquidity, profitability or\ncash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities derived in accordance with Ind AS, Indian\nGAAP, IFRS or U.S. GAAP. We compute and disclose such non-Indian GAAP financial measures and such other\nstatistical information relating to our operations and financial performance as we consider such information to be\nuseful measures of our business and financial performance. These non-Indian GAAP financial measures and other\nstatistical and other information relating to our operations and financial performance may not be computed on the\nbasis of any standard methodology that is applicable across the industry and therefore may not be comparable to\nfinancial measures and statistical information of similar nomenclature that may be computed and presented by\nother companies and are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by Ind AS and may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. For the risks relating to our Non-GAAP\nMeasures, see “Risk Factors – We track certain operational metrics and non-GAAP (generally accepted\naccounting principles) measures for our operations with internal systems and tools and do not independently\nverify such metrics.

All statements regarding our\nexpected financial condition and results of operations, business, plans and prospects are forward looking\nstatements, which may include statements with respect to our business strategy, our revenue and profitability, our\ngoals and other such matters discussed in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus regarding matters that are not\nhistorical facts. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words or phrases such as “aim”,\n“anticipate”, “believe”, “goal”, “expect”, “estimate”, “intend”, “likely to”, “objective”, “plan”, “projected”,\n“should” “will”, “will continue”, “seek to”, “will pursue” or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly,\nstatements that describe our expected financial conditions, results of operations, strategies, objectives, prospects,\nplans or goals are also forward-looking statements. However, these are not the exclusive means of identifying\nforward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements whether made by us or any third parties in this Draft\nRed Herring Prospectus are based on our current plans, estimates, presumptions and expectations and are subject\nto risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ncontemplated by the relevant forward-looking statement.\nActual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements due to risks or\nuncertainties associated with the expectations with respect to, but not limited to, regulatory changes pertaining to\nthe industry in which our Company has businesses and our ability to respond to them, our ability to successfully\nimplement our strategy, our growth and expansion, technological changes, our exposure to market risks, general\neconomic and political conditions in India and globally which have an impact on our business activities or\ninvestments, the monetary and fiscal policies of India, inflation, deflation, unanticipated turbulence in interest\nrates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices or other rates or prices, the performance of the financial markets in\nIndia and globally, incidence of any natural calamities and/or acts of violence, changes in laws, regulations and\ntaxes and changes in competition in our industry.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n• we have experienced losses and negative cash flows experienced by us from operations since inception;\n• our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult;\n• our dependence on the demand for and adoption of E2Ws;\n• our ability to attract customers;\n• our competitiveness within the highly competitive Indian automotive market depends on our ability to\nsuccessfully develop, market and deliver new and quality EV models and launch new associated services;\n• defects or quality issues in our EVs, software, charging infrastructure, accessories or the components used in\nthe manufacture of our EVs (electric vehicles) may cause us to fail to meet industry standards or advertised\nperformance levels;\n• we currently derive our revenue predominantly from the sale of limited electric two-wheeler models. If our\nE2Ws are not well-received by the market, our business and future prospects;\n• if our E2Ws do not meet the promised level of performance and quality, we may be required to undertake\nproduct recalls or other corrective actions;\n• failure of our suppliers to deliver components used in our E2Ws as agreed, may cause delays in our\nmanufacturing and delivery timelines or an increase in the retail price of our EVs; and\n• the retail prices of our electric two-wheelers are susceptible to a reduction or elimination of government\nincentives or the ineligibility of our electric two-wheelers for such incentives. The increase in retail price\ncould affect customer demand and in turn, adversely impact our business and prospects.\nFor a further discussion on factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations, see “Risk\nFactors”, “Our Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” on pages 36, 225 and 396, respectively.

            "page_content": "suppliers may be compelled to initiate product recalls. While we have not undertaken any product recalls\nunder the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, in Fiscal Years 2024, 2023 and 2022, there is no guarantee that we\nwill not be required to or opt to recall our E2Ws or accessories in the future. Such inspections, recalls,\nrepairs and replacements involve significant expenses, the possibility of lawsuits, and diversion of\nmanagement’s attention and other resources. Any of the foregoing could harm our reputation and lead to\nloss of revenue, delivery delays, customer complaints, breach of warranty and related consumer\nprotection claims and significant warranty and lawsuits, and in turn, materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n10. The retail prices of our electric two-wheelers are susceptible to a reduction or elimination of\ngovernment incentives or the ineligibility of our electric two-wheelers for such incentives. The increase\nin retail price could affect customer demand and in turn, adversely impact our business and prospects.\nWe benefit from certain government incentives such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of\nElectric (“FAME”) subsidy, which was introduced by the then Department of Heavy Industry in 2015\nand expired on March 31, 2024, and superseded by the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme 2024\n(“EMPS 2024”) effective from April 1, 2024. Reduction, elimination or ineligibility for such government\nincentives, or any reduction, elimination, non-receipt or delays in receiving such incentives, could reduce\nthe demand for E2Ws and potentially result in us becoming less price competitive compared to\nconventional ICE 2Ws. For instance, the benefits we avail from the total enhanced outlay under EMPS\n2024 may reduce or we may be rendered ineligible therefor, or the extension in the past in the duration\nof the EMPS 2024 from July 31, 2024 to September 30, 2024 may not be recurrent in the future. Further,\nthe eligible EV category under EMPS 2024 extends beyond E2Ws and covers electric three-wheelers as\nwell which impacts the aggregate disbursable outlay under EMPS 2024 in respect of E2Ws. Whilst we\nare not compelled to do so, such policy changes may require us to pass on the additional expenses to our\nconsumers, thereby increasing the retail price of our E2Ws. For example, the Government of India has\nin the past recalled and scaled back, and may in the future recall or scale back, the benefits available to\nEV manufacturers under its schemes, increasing the costs borne by EV manufacturers. For example,\npursuant to a notification dated May 19, 2023 from the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of\nIndia, the cap on incentives for the FAME scheme was scaled back from ₹15,000 per kWh to ₹10,000\nper kWh, with effect from June 1, 2023. As a result of the reduced subsidy, our customers faced an\nincrease in the retail price of our E2Ws ranging from ₹20,434 to ₹30,285. This contributed to a slight\ndecrease in our revenue from operations from ₹17,809 million in Fiscal Year 2023 to ₹17,538 million in\nFiscal Year 2024. For further details, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations – Summary Results of Operations - Fiscal Year 2024 compared\nto Fiscal Year 2023 – Revenue from operations” on page 406.\nWhile we may be eligible for future schemes from the Indian or foreign governments, there is no\nassurance that we will be successful in such applications and nor can we guarantee that the funds allocated\nunder such schemes will be available to us in a timely manner.\nAvailability of government subsidies may be critical to accelerating the adoption of E2Ws. In the absence\nof such support, we cannot assure you that consumers will continue to purchase E2Ws at the same pace\nin light of competition from conventional ICE 2W that are manufactured by long-standing industry\nplayers whose cost structures may be lower than ours on a non-subsidised basis.\n11. If our electric two-wheelers become ineligible for the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme 2024, or\nsuch incentives are reduced or eliminated, the retail price of our electric two-wheelers could increase\nand demand for our products may decline.\nWith effect from April 1, 2024, the FAME subsidies were replaced by the EMPS 2024 subsidy. The\nEMPS 2024 subsidy was originally a limited funding scheme of ₹5 billion that was due to expire on July\n31, 2024. On July 26, 2024, the Ministry of Heavy Industries announced an extension of the EMPS 2024\nsubsidy up to September 30, 2024 with an increased funding amount of ₹7.78 billion. We have obtained\nEMPS 2024 subsidies for Ather 450S, Ather 450X and Ather Rizta (S and Z). The Ather 450 Apex does\nnot benefit from the EMPS 2024 subsidy. There is no guarantee that this scheme will be further extended\nor be replaced with another scheme.\n42",

We may not realise expected returns\nfrom such investments in the future. Our ability to achieve profitability, positive cash flows from\noperating activities and a net working capital surplus will depend on many factors, including our ability\nto increase our total revenue, fully utilise our production capacity to produce E2Ws at scale, control our\ncosts, increase sales of our E2Ws in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka and any other international markets that\nwe enter, expand our charging infrastructure, and expand our business internationally. We cannot assure\nyou that our expansion into international markets will be profitable, nor can we guarantee that our\nproducts can be sold at favourable margins. Failure to become profitable would materially and adversely\naffect the value of your investment in our Company.\n2. Our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult.\nOur Company was incorporated in 2013 and launched our first E2W, the Ather 450, in June 2018. As we\nhave a limited operating history, there is a limited historical basis on which we can make judgements\nregarding our ability to develop, manufacture, and deliver E2Ws or their components or our results of\noperations, including our ability to achieve profitability in the future. Our historical revenue growth\nshould not be considered indicative of our future performance.\nFurther, when analysing our business and prospects, consideration should also be given to the risks and\nchallenges our Company faces as a new entrant to the EV industry. These include, our ability to develop\nour underlying technologies, navigate the dynamic EV regulatory framework domestically and abroad,\nmanufacture reliable E2Ws, related components and accessories, expand our product portfolio and\nenhance our brand image. If we are unsuccessful in addressing any or all of the risks and challenges we\nface as a pure play EV company, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n3. Our future growth is dependent on the demand for and adoption of electric two-wheelers. If the market\ndoes not develop as we expect, or develops at a speed that is slower than anticipated, our business,\nprospects, financial condition and operating results will be affected.\nDemand for our E2Ws and services greatly depends on the demand for EVs in the Indian EV market,\nand in particular, E2Ws. According to the CRISIL Report, in the last two to three years, EV offerings\nhave increased multi-fold with the entry of new players, expansion of legacy players and profile\nexpansion of current players. However, compared to internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles, EV\noptions are still at a nascent stage. Further, there is generally a limited awareness and understanding of\nthe benefits such as a lower total cost of ownership, that EVs offer beyond environmental gains. The\nlimited awareness and understanding of these benefits may restrict the mass scale adoption of EVs,\naccording to the CRISIL Report. Factors that may influence the adoption of EVs include:\n• perceptions about EV quality, safety, design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events\nor accidents occur that are linked to the quality, safety or durability of EVs, whether such vehicles\nare produced by us or other companies;\n• uncertainty about EV resale value;\n• developments in alternative technologies in ICE vehicles, such as advanced diesel, hydrogen,\nethanol, fuel cells, or compressed natural gas, improvements in the fuel economy or other features\n37\n\n[TABLES]\n|  |  |  | Fiscal Year |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  | 2024 |  |  | 2023 |  |  | 2022 | \n |  |  |  | (₹ million) |  |  |  |  |  |  |",

Unexpected changes in business conditions, quality of the components, poor business\nethics, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material costs and currency fluctuations, labour\nissues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics and pandemics, trade and shipping\ndisruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control could\naffect these suppliers’ ability to provide an adequate and steady supply of components to us or their\npricing.\nThe unavailability of any component or inability of suppliers to supply such components to a satisfactory\nquality could result in production delays or line stoppages, and consequently delivery delays, as well as\nidle manufacturing facilities, longer servicing times and product design changes. It could also impact our\ncapacity expansion and our ability to fulfil other obligations under customer contracts. For example, a\nglobal shortage of semiconductors between Fiscal Years 2021 and 2023 impacted our supply chain and\nproduction. Our suppliers may discontinue the supply of certain components for a variety of reasons\nincluding, as a result of their corporate strategy re-alignment or insolvency.\nWhile we have not faced any material difficulties in retaining our suppliers or finding alternative\nsuppliers or experienced any material supply shortages in Fiscal Years 2024, 2023 and 2022, other than\nthe aforementioned semiconductor shortage, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue\nretaining our suppliers on commercially favourable terms or to find alternative suppliers or maintain a\nsteady supply of components. Such occurrences could result in increased production costs, which could\nresult in an increase in the retail price of our E2Ws and adversely affect sales of our E2Ws.\n13. Any disruptions in the availability and any changes in the pricing and quality of lithium-ion cells\ncould cause significant disruptions to and adversely impact our business operations.\nWe sourced our lithium-ion cells, one of the critical components in our E2Ws, from two foreign suppliers\nlocated in China and South Korea in the last three Fiscal Years. As we rely on foreign suppliers for the\nsupply of lithium-ion cells and our general purchase agreements with our cell suppliers do not specify\nterms such as price and quantum, we face more pronounced risks relating to the availability, pricing and\nquality of lithium-ion cells. These risks include disruptions in the supply of lithium-ion cells due to a\ndemand surplus for lithium-ion cells or quality issues or recalls by cell manufacturers.\nThe growth in popularity of EVs without a significant expansion in cell production capacity could result\nin shortages and cause suppliers to increase their prices, thereby increasing our own production costs.\nAn increase in the cost of, or decrease in the available supply of, raw materials used in cell manufacturing,\nsuch as lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese oxides, aluminium, graphite, copper and other minerals, or\nthe occurrence of natural disasters, logistical interruptions, local disruptions, trade restrictions or labour\nshortages could also affect our suppliers’ manufacturing schedules and supplies.\nFurther, in relation to the sourcing lithium-ion cells from China, we may experience supply disruptions\nand increased costs in the event of any changes in the polices, rules and regulations of the Indian or\nChinese government relating to imports or exports from China, whether as a result of geopolitical factors\nor for other reasons, such as the implementation of trade tariffs or a complete halt on imports from China.\nWhile we have not experienced any material disruptions in the supply of or adverse changes in the pricing\nor quality of the lithium-ion cells that we imported in the past three Fiscal Years, there is no assurance\nthat such risks will not materialise in the future. We cannot assure you that in the event of such\noccurrences, we will be able to find alternative suppliers of lithium-ion cells in a timely manner in\nsufficient quantities, to our required specifications and quality levels, or at reasonable prices.\nAny of the aforementioned events would impact our projected manufacturing and delivery timelines, and\n45",

There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain acceptable\narrangements with our partners.\nAlthough our third-party service providers may have experience in servicing ICE vehicles or other EVs,\nthey may have limited experience in servicing our E2Ws. Servicing E2Ws is different from servicing\nICE vehicles and requires certain specialised skills. For instance, safety precautions in handling batteries\nand high voltage electricals and awareness of vehicle software integration are required in servicing E2Ws.\nIf our retail partners fail to provide satisfactory service, we may suffer adverse implications to our\nreputation and may be subject to lawsuits. Our retail partners may also have insufficient resources or\ninventory to meet our customers’ service requirements in a timely manner, particularly as our product\nportfolio and the volume of Ather E2Ws sold increases. Similarly, while some of our third-party dealers\nhave experience selling ICE vehicles at scale, they may have more limited experience selling E2Ws.\nWe may also face difficulties in retaining our retail partners or recruiting new retail partners or authorised\ndistributors. This can be due to various factors, including profitability concerns or more competitive\nterms of arrangement being offered by our competitors. In cases where a retail partner or authorised\ndistributor notifies us of their intention to close their experience centre or service centre, we may opt to\neither allow it to close or in some cases acquire such a centre and operate it ourselves in the interim until\na new retail partner or authorised distributor can be recruited. Operating such experience or service\ncentres in the interim will give rise to additional expenses for our Company. The closing of key\nexperience and service centres, particularly in cities with a limited number of experience and service\ncentres, may cause us to lose customers within such cities and adversely affect the quality of services to\nexisting customers. While our retail partners’ closures in the past have not had a material impact on our\nbusiness, there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future. For example, a retail\npartner in Mumbai resigned, and to maintain the continuity of our business in this location, we opened a\ncompany owned and operated experience centre at the same location in April 2024.

The land on which we propose to construct Factory 3.0 has been leased to us by\nthe Maharashtra Industrial Township Limited (“MITL”) and we have entered into a sub-lease deed dated\nAugust 1, 2024 with MITL for a period of 95 years. As part of the terms and conditions of the sub-lease\ndeed, before commencing construction, we are required to obtain approval of the plans and specification\nof Factory 3.0 within 24 months from the date of execution of the sub-lease deed with MITL, obtain a\nconsent to establish from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, and we are required to complete\nconstruction within five years from the date of execution of the sub-lease deed with MITL. If we fail to\ncomply with such terms and conditions, we may be subject to fines, penalties, legal proceedings and\ncancellation of the sub-lease/ allotment of land.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to comply with the requirements of government supervision\nor procure requisite business approvals in a timely manner or at all. While we have not experienced any\nsuch delays in the execution of our expansion projects in the past three Fiscal Years, any such delays\ncould result in us becoming subject to administrative uncertainty, fines, or the suspension of use of such\nproject. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business operations.\n23. Any failure of our products or technology systems, breaches in data security or privacy concerns, and\nany failure on our part to address such issues, could harm our reputation and growth prospects, and\ncause us to incur substantial costs to remedy such issues.\nOur products and technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruptions from, among others, fire,\nnatural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, errors, glitches, bugs, vulnerabilities or design\ndefects, which could result in service interruptions or system failures, and our systems are subject to\ncertain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives.\nWe may face technological failures, such hardware failures, product software failures, and internal\nsoftware failures. We have experienced minor hardware failures in the past (although none have\nmaterially affected our operations), and such hardware failures may occur in the future. In addition, the\nproduct software updates that we deploy through OTA updates may fail to properly update the vehicles’\nsoftware or otherwise have unintended consequences, including software failure. While we have not\nfaced any material product software failures in the past three Fiscal Years, such issues may be difficult\nto detect and may only be discovered after the OTA update has been released for external or internal use.\nFurther, failure of our internal information system technology may disrupt our operations and prevent us\nfrom delivering our products and services in a timely manner. Whilst we have not experienced any\nmaterial internal software failures in the past three Fiscal Years, we cannot assure you that this will not\nhappen in the future.\nIf we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy such software and hardware issues in a cost effective\nand timely manner, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\ncould be adversely affected. In the event that our technology systems are unable to handle the additional\nbusiness volume, our service capabilities, operating efficiency and future business volume may decline.\nWhile we have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorised\naccess to our product and internal information technology networks, databases and our E2Ws and their\nsystems and have not experienced any such attacks in the past, hackers may, in the future, attempt to gain\nunauthorised access to modify, alter, and use our networks, E2Ws, and systems to gain control of, or to\nchange, our E2Ws’ functionality, customer interface, and performance characteristics; carry out\ncomputer denial of service attacks; or gain access to data stored in or generated by the E2Ws.\nVulnerabilities could be identified in the future and our remediation efforts may not be successful.

            "page_content": "Certain of our competitors, including those that are incumbent ICE players, have a wider distribution\nreach than our company. As a result, they may have a higher rate of market penetration than us in certain\nmarkets and we may face entry barriers to successfully compete with them. Further, wider distribution\nnetworks may lead to greater brand visibility and recognition, which could entrench customers in those\nregions to our competitors. Extensive distribution channels may also offer better convenience to ensure\nhigher product availability and faster delivery times, which could promote brand loyalty. As a result of\nthese factors, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be\nadversely affected.\n28. Any insufficiency of our warranty reserves to cover future warranty claims could have an adverse\nimpact on our financials.\nAs we commenced the delivery of our E2Ws in September 2018, we have a limited operating history in\nterms of responding to warranty claims and have experienced a limited number of warranty claims\nrelating to our E2Ws to date. Therefore, we have a limited basis upon which to estimate our future\nexpenses related to warranty claims and the appropriate level of warranty provisions that we should\nmaintain. We have warranty provisions of ₹1,076 million, ₹820 million and ₹241 million as at March\n31, 2024, March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The amount of the warranty reserve\nrepresents our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties, as well as\nthe nature and frequency of future claims. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations – Summary Results of Operations – Selected Restated Statement\nof Assets and Liabilities” on page 414.\nWe currently offer a three-year/30,000 km (whichever is earlier) warranty for all our E2W models. We\noffer a five-year/60,000 km (whichever is earlier) warranty for the Ather 450 Apex battery pack, while\nthe battery packs for other E2W models come with a three-year/30,000 km (whichever is earlier)\nwarranty; with an extended battery warranty option available for an additional two years/30,000 km\n(whichever is earlier) totalling to five years/60,000 km (whichever is earlier), for an additional fee. Our\nwarranty program is intended to cover all parts and labour costs to repair defects in manufacturing and\nworkmanship. We also offer battery replacements for any batteries whose state-of-health falls below 70%\nwithin the coverage period. We plan to introduce a new extended battery warranty program in the first\nhalf of Fiscal Year 2025, which will extend the battery warranty to eight years /80,000 km (whichever is\nearlier).\nWhile we have completed the standard warranty cycles for our Ather 450 and Ather 450X scooters, we\ncannot guarantee that our warranty reserves will be sufficient in the future. As at March 31, 2024, we\nhave not received any customer claims under the extended battery warranty. Nonetheless, we may, in the\nfuture, face significant warranty claims, resulting in substantial expenses that could materially and\nadversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. As we aim to increase sales\nvolumes and expand our product line, we could see a rise in warranty claims, necessitating an increase\nin our warranty reserves.\nWe monitor and adjust warranty provisions based on actual and estimated future warranty costs. For\ninstance, we took into account the battery warranty claims from our customers relating to battery\nperformance in Fiscal Years 2023 and 2022 when setting our Fiscal Year 2024 provisions. Although we\nhave an insurance policy to underwrite liabilities for the two-year extended warranty period for our\nbatteries, our third-party partners cover only up to ₹100,000 for battery repairs or replacement per E2W.\nAny battery failures exceeding ₹100,000 in repair costs per E2W will be covered by our Company. There\nis no assurance that these insurance policies or provisions will sufficiently cover all incurred costs. We\ncannot guarantee that costs associated with extended warranty claims will not adversely affect our future\nresults of operations or that our warranty provisions will be adequate to cover all future claims.\n29. The automotive industry and its technology are rapidly evolving and may be subject to unforeseen\nchanges which could adversely affect the demand for our electric two-wheelers or increase our\noperating costs.\nWe may be unable to keep up with changes in EV technology or alternatives to electricity as a fuel source\nand, as a result, our competitiveness may suffer. We have invested in our R&D capabilities to keep up\nwith these technological trends and have set out our R&D expenses in the table below, as at the dates\n56",

If our customers alter or customise our electric two-wheelers with aftermarket parts or severely\ndamage our electric two-wheelers, such electric two-wheelers may not operate properly and impact\nour reputation.\nCustomers may alter or customise our E2Ws with aftermarket parts or severely damage our E2Ws\nthrough accidents or by using improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets, such as incorrect\nchargers or plug points. Such actions can severely damage or compromise our E2Ws’ performance,\nsafety, charging systems and security systems, and in the case of severe damages, expose our customers\nto injury from high voltage electricity or cause our batteries to catch on fire. For example, in Fiscal Year\n2022, the battery case of one of our E2Ws was severely damaged due to a traffic accident. Following\nroutine service, water inadvertently seeped into the battery, which subsequently caught on fire. While\nthis incident did not have a material impact on our business nor cause any bodily injuries, and we are not\naware of any other material incidents arising from modifications or misuse in Fiscal Years 2024, 2023\nand 2022, there is no assurance that they will not arise in the future.

An intellectual property registration granted to us may not be sufficient to protect our\nintellectual property rights. We may also be susceptible to claims from third-parties asserting\ninfringement and other related claims. While we have not been subject to any material intellectual\nproperty claims in Fiscal Years 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were instances of unauthorised usage of our\nintellectual property by third-parties in such Fiscal Years. For instance, in Fiscal Year 2024, an\nunauthorised party misused the ‘Ather’ brand name which is currently a registered trademark. Although\nall unauthorised usages were remedied in Fiscal Years 2024, 2023 and 2022 following the service of\nnecessary notices, monitoring unauthorised use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and the\nsteps we will take to prevent misappropriation in the future may not be successful. From time to time,\nwe may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of our resources. Implementation and enforcement of Indian laws relating\nto intellectual property have historically been deficient and ineffective, and may not be as effective as in\nthe United States or other developed countries. Failure to defend, maintain or protect these rights could\nharm our business. Any unauthorised use of our intellectual property by third-parties may adversely\naffect our current and future revenues and our reputation.\nWe may in the future become party to additional, intellectual property infringement claims or\nproceedings. Companies, including our competitors, or individuals, may hold or obtain patents,\ntrademarks or other proprietary or intellectual property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with\nour ability to make, use, develop, sell, or market our E2Ws or EV accessories, which could make it more\ndifficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive inquiries from holders of\npatents or trademarks inquiring whether we infringe their proprietary rights or may have lawsuits filed\nagainst us by holders of patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary\nrights alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating their rights, or\nmay be required to execute settlement agreements. Litigation or other legal proceedings relating to\nintellectual property claims, regardless of merit, may cause us to incur significant expenses and divert\nthe attention and resources of our management and key personnel. If we are determined to have infringed\nupon a third-party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease sales of the products that\nincorporate or use the intellectual property right under dispute, incur additional costs in redesigning our\nproducts, pay royalties, licensing fees or other damages or obtain a licence from the holder of the\ninfringed intellectual property which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Such licences\ncould be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third-parties access to the same\ntechnologies licensed to us.

We are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and failure to comply\nwith such laws and regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, suspensions or revocations of our\npermits and other consequences.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to a wide range of increasingly strict environmental, health and\nsafety laws and regulations in India, including the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974,\nthe Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981, the Environment Protection Act 1986 and the\nHazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, the Battery\nWaste Management Rules, 2022, the E-Waste Management Rules, 2022, the Plastic Waste Management\nRules, 2016, as well as the rules and regulations implemented thereunder. Such laws and regulations\naddress, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, releases into the environment, human\nexposure to hazardous materials, the storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of wastes and\nhazardous materials, the investigation and clean-up of contamination, process safety, and the\nmaintenance of health and safety conditions in the workplace, and impose certain restrictions or onerous\nconditions on our business operations. We are required to comply with applicable battery disposal\nregulations and may face issues with the disposal and recycling of our lithium-ion cells and battery\nmodules. For example, under the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, as a producer of EV batteries,\nwe are responsible for the batteries that we introduce into the market, including ensuring that the batteries\nare recycled and/or refurbished. Furthermore, many of our operating permits require that we comply with\napplicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. While we are not aware of any\nviolations of applicable environmental, health or safety requirements in Fiscal Years 2024, 2023 and\n2022, there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance. Violations of such laws and\nregulations could subject us to significant fines and penalties, the suspension, revocation or non-renewal\nof our permits, production delays or limitations, imprisonment, or the closure of our plants. We have\nincurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing capital and operating expenditures to ensure\ncompliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

Our use of open source software in our applications can subject our proprietary software to general\nrelease and subject us to litigation, claims or proceedings.\nOur development and deployment processes for our E2Ws incorporate open source software, which\ncarries the risk of potential claims from third-parties alleging infringement or non-compliance with open\nsource licensing terms. While we are not aware of any such claims made against us in Fiscal Years 2024,\n2023 and 2022, we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to such challenges in the future. While\nwe will monitor the use of open source software and try to ensure that open source software is not used\nin a manner that would subject our proprietary source code to general release and restrictions, such use\ncould occur as open source licence terms are often ambiguous and have generally not been interpreted\nby Indian or foreign courts.\nThe technical and legal risks associated with using open source software can be higher than those\nassociated with using commercially licensed third-party software. Our reliance on open source software\nfor certain parts of our platform means that any undetected errors or defects could disrupt our deployment\nor compromise the functionality of our systems, potentially damaging our reputation.

Customers may face difficulties charging their electric two-wheelers, particularly during long distance\ntravels, as a result of inadequate access to public charging infrastructure. This in turn, could\nmaterially and adversely affect demand for our electric two-wheelers.\nAccording to the CRISIL Report, while E2Ws are sold with dedicated personal chargers, India’s current\nlimited public charging infrastructure poses a threat to the mass adoption of EVs primarily due to, among\nothers, the anxiety of being unable to find a functional charger in case of sudden need. The demand for\nour E2Ws therefore depends, in part, on the availability of public charging infrastructure, particularly for\ncustomers wishing to charge their E2Ws during long distance travels. If customers anticipate difficulties\nin on-the-road charging, it may deter potential customers from purchasing our E2Ws and choose ICE\nalternatives instead. This in turn, would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nFor further details on our charging infrastructure, please see “Our Business – Other Business Description\n– Our Charging Infrastructure” on page 257.\n50.

The data collected are\nprocessed by the Ather Data Platform, which gives us intelligence on customer cohort usage patterns,\nproduct performance, post-sales journey and charging insights.\nData collection and analysis help us customise and optimise the driving and riding experiences of our\nE2Ws and provide additional features such as Trip Planner. For example, we are required to comply with\nthe Information Technology Act, 2000 and the rules notified thereunder, including the Information\nTechnology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information)\nRules, 2011, which prescribe, inter alia, directions for the collection, disclosure, transfer and protection\nof sensitive personal data.

Although we have not experienced any material delays in the commencement of operations\nat our other facilities, there is no assurance that delays will not occur in the future. Such delays may be\ncaused by events beyond our control and may affect our ability to complete the Factory 3.0 in accordance\nwith the proposed schedule of implementation, which could have an adverse impact on our growth,\nprospects, cash flows and financial condition.\nFurther, the D&B Report provides that there may be inter alia (i) time and cost overrun in relation to\ncompletion and operationalisation of lines 1-3 of Phase 1 of Factory 3.0, (ii) risks in relation to obtaining\nrequired approvals from governmental authorities in a timely manner, (iii) technological risks, (iv) force\nmajeure events, etc. The above-mentioned issues may arise due to lack of availability of funds, improper\nimplementation, dependence on third parties regarding machineries and software. Further, if the required\ngovernment approvals are not obtained in a timely manner, it can cause delay in initiating production or\ninstallation of machineries, in relation to Phase 1. Any delay in financing this project could significantly\ndelay our plans to expand our operations and achieve economies of scale for our E2Ws.\n35. The functioning of our electric two-wheelers is highly dependent on the health and functioning of key\ncomponents, such as our battery packs. If customers perceive the cost of replacing these components\nin our electric two-wheelers to be high, they may choose not to purchase our electric two-wheelers.\nOur E2Ws are comprised of key components such as our battery packs, and the functioning of our E2Ws\ndepends heavily on the state of health of these components. Our battery packs constitute a significant\nportion of our BOM. For instance, the battery pack made up 31% of the BOM for the Ather 450X (2.9\nkWh) variant, as at March 31, 2024. The lithium-ion cells used in our battery packs are designed for\nsingle use, which means that they cannot be repaired or reused. Once the battery packs installed in our\nE2Ws reach the end of their lifecycles, they would need to be replaced.\nSome of our customers may consider the cost of replacing the battery packs in our E2Ws to be high, and\nin such cases, they may elect to purchase other 2Ws instead. As a result, we may lose customers or\nexperience a lower demand for our E2Ws, which will adversely impact our business and prospects.\n36. Compared to internal combustion engine two-wheelers, the network of repair and service centres for\nelectric two-wheelers have a much restricted geographical spread, which may deter customers from\npurchasing our electric two-wheelers.\nAccording to the CRISIL Report, E2W repair and service centres have a much restricted geographical\nspread as compared to those available for ICE 2Ws. As a result, customers might be hesitant to purchase\nour E2W due to concerns about the availability and accessibility of repair and service centres compared\nto the well-established networks for ICE 2Ws. This perceived lack of support and service options for\nE2Ws could slow down the adoption of EVs as customers may prefer the security of the established ICE\nservice infrastructure. These could, in turn, adversely affect our future sales, business, prospects,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n37.

Nonetheless, there is no assurance that other players will not adopt a different\ncharging standard. If other EV players adopt a different charging standard that is not compatible with our\nE2Ws, our customers will have limited access to the public charging infrastructures available in India\nand face difficulties in charging their E2Ws during commute, due to their dependency on the Ather Grid\nand other LECCS chargers. This may reduce the demand for our E2Ws as well as the demand for the\nAther Grid charging services outside our existing customer base.\nTo the extent that we are unable to meet our customers’ expectations or experience difficulties with\nproviding accessible charging solutions, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows may be materially and adversely affected. For further details on our charging\ninfrastructure, please see “Our Business – Other Business Description – Our Charging Infrastructure”\non page 230.\n46. The power used to charge our electric two-wheeler battery packs are partly generated by non-\nrenewable sources and the use of these may not be environmentally sustainable.\nOur Company and our customers partly use non-renewable energy sources to charge our E2Ws. The use\nof such non-renewable energies to power our E2Ws may have a negative impact on the environment. In\naddition, the perceived environmental costs of charging E2W batteries may deter customers who are\noriginally drawn to E2Ws for their environmentally friendly reputation. This could impact the demand\nfor our E2Ws as customers may instead choose to purchase ICE 2Ws, which could result in a decrease\nin the sales of our E2Ws thus adversely impacting our business, prospects, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\n47. The manufacturing of our electric two-wheelers and later discharge of our battery packs are associated\nwith environmental hazards, especially given that our lithium-ion cells are not designed to be repaired\nor reused.\nThe manufacturing of E2Ws can have significant environmental impacts. These include air pollution\nfrom the mining of raw materials required for our lithium-ion cells, large volumes of water consumed\nduring the mining process and the sizeable carbon footprint from the transportation of the lithium-ion\ncells to our facilities to be assembled into battery packs. In addition, as our lithium-ion cells are designed\nfor one-time use and therefore cannot be repaired or reused, the improper disposal or improper recycling\nof such cells may result in the release of hazardous waste material into the environment, posing risks of\ntoxic exposure to humans and potential contamination of natural habitats. According to the CRISIL\nReport, the net carbon dioxide emissions from an E2W is three tonnes during its entire lifecycle as\ncompared to 4.8 tonnes for an ICE 2W.\nWhile no material instances of environmental harm have occurred in the past three Fiscal Years, should\nour E2Ws or their manufacturing processes cause environmental harm that exceeds the parameters set\nby relevant laws and regulations, we could face substantial monetary fines and penalties, the suspension,\nrevocation or non-renewal of our permits, production delays or limitations, imposition of terms of\nimprisonment, or the closure of our plants.

Our funding\nrequirement is based on management estimates, current state of our business and prevailing market\nconditions, which are subject to changes in external factors. These factors include financial and market\nconditions, market feedback and demand of our products, competition, business strategy and\ninterest/exchange rate fluctuations, which may not be within the control of our management. Given the\ncompetitive landscape of our industry, there may be a need to periodically revise our business plan and\nmanagement estimates, which could lead to changes in our funding needs. These internal estimates could\nvary from those that might be obtained through third-party appraisals, potentially necessitating\nadjustments to our expenditure projections, subject to applicable laws. See “Objects of the Offer” on\npage 142.\nShould actual expenses exceed projections or if there is a shortfall in the required funds, we will seek\nadditional capital by any means available, including internal accruals and securing further equity or debt\nfinancing.

This provides an exit opportunity to the Shareholders who do not agree to vary the Objects\nof the Offer, at such price and in such manner in accordance with applicable law.\nOur Company, in accordance with the applicable law and to attain the Objects set out above, will have\nthe flexibility to deploy the Net Proceeds. Pending utilisation of the Net Proceeds for the purposes\ndescribed above, our Company may temporarily deposit the Net Proceeds with one or more scheduled\ncommercial banks included in the Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 as may be\napproved by our Board.

Our Company was incorporated in 2013 and launched our first E2W in June 2018. Given our\nlimited operating history, it is difficult for us to accurately predict the exact nature or effect of seasonality\non our results of operations. Moreover, if the revenue generated from the sales of our E2Ws does not\nalign with our projections, our business may be adversely affected as many of our operational costs are\nfixed and predicated on expected yearly revenue figures.\n59.

While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions\nin the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited. In addition, the policies\nof the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) may change from time to time, which may limit our ability to\neffectively hedge our foreign currency exposures and may have an adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\n64. We may not be able to pay dividends in the future.\nOur Company’s ability to distribute dividends will depend on internal factors such as earning stability,\npast dividend trends, free cash flow for the period under consideration, borrowing capacity, profitability\nof our Company during the period under consideration and external factors, including but not limited to\nthe macro-economic environment, market conditions, prevailing legal requirements and regulatory\nconditions or restrictions laid down under the applicable laws including tax laws and industry outlook\nfor business in which our Company operates. In addition, the ability of our Company to pay dividends\nmay be impacted by a number of factors, including change in tax laws, restrictive covenants under the\nloans or financing arrangements our Company is currently availing of or may enter into to finance our\nfunding requirements for our business activities. Further, our Company has not declared and paid any\ndividend in the past three Fiscal Years or up to the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus. Decisions\nregarding the declaration and distribution of dividends are at the discretion of our Board and will be made\nin line with our dividend distribution policy. These decisions will be based on a variety of considerations\nthat our Board considers pertinent, such as the factors outlined above. For further details, see “Dividend\nPolicy” on page 318.\n65. We are or may be subject to risks associated with strategic alliances or acquisitions\nWe have entered into and may in the future enter into strategic alliances, such as joint ventures or equity\ninvestments, with various third-parties to further our business purpose from time to time. For example,\nwe have entered into a collaboration agreement with Hero MotoCorp Limited (“HMCL”) dated\nNovember 23, 2023 (the “Collaboration Agreement”), pursuant to which our Company and HMCL\nhave agreed to collaborate on enabling the interoperability of charging stations and other ancillary\nactivities. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, our Company and HMCL have agreed to develop\nand set up a charging management system in relation to interoperability between the charging stations of\nour Company and of HMCL, through open charge point interface (“OCPI”). Accordingly, EVs of HMCL\nand EVs of our Company will be able to access and charge at both charging stations of our Company and\nHMCL, respectively, and such usage would be referred to as “Roaming Session”. For further details,\nsee “History and Certain Corporate Matters – Other material agreements” on page 292.\nThese alliances could expose us to various risks, including those associated with sharing proprietary\ninformation, non-performance by the third-party and increased expenses in establishing new strategic\nalliances. Our capacity to oversee or influence our partners' actions is limited, and to the extent any of\nthese associates encounter negative publicity, our own reputation may be affected due to our association\nwith them. Additionally, inefficiencies in processes or inadequate training of personnel could lead to\noperational shortcomings and elevated expenses. Furthermore, any problems arising from our partners’\nuse of licensed technologies, including product recalls, safety issues, or resulting legal disputes, could\nnegatively harm the ‘Ather’ brand. Any of these risks may materially and adversely affect our business,\nresults of operation and financial conditions.\nMoreover, we may acquire additional assets, products, technologies or businesses that are\ncomplementary to our current operations. In addition to shareholder approvals, these acquisitions may\nalso require regulatory approvals and compliance with relevant Indian or foreign laws, potentially\ncausing delays and additional costs, and could disrupt our business strategy if not obtained. Past and\nfuture acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own require\nsignificant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing\nbusiness, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations. There is no guarantee that\nacquired assets or businesses will yield the expected financial returns. Acquisitions could result in the\nuse of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of\nsignificant goodwill impairment charges, amortisation expenses for other intangible assets and exposure\nto potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business.

Heightened\ngeo-political and economic tensions may affect our ability to expand outside of India, which may also be\naffected by protectionist policies from the government of the target market. As we depend on certain EV\ncomponents from suppliers, some of which are overseas, tariffs by the Indian government on such\nsuppliers may also affect the cost of our products.\nConducting and launching international operations require close coordination of activities across multiple\njurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources. We will also be subject to\na number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our\nability to sell our E2Ws and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n• difficulties attracting customers in new jurisdictions;\n• being subject to foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, especially in\nrelation to the incorporation of a company under foreign laws;\n• difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations and complying with foreign labour laws\nand regulation;\n• conforming our E2Ws to applicable international regulatory requirements where our E2Ws are\nsold and serviced, which requirements may change over time;\n• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any\nforeign currency swap or other hedging activities we may undertake;\n• changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n• United States and foreign government trade restrictions, tariffs and price or exchange controls;\n• expenditures related to foreign lawsuits and liability;\n• difficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights;\n• laws and business practices favouring local companies;\n• political instability, natural disasters, wars or events of terrorism and health epidemics and\npandemics; and\n• the strength of international economies.\nIf we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of\noperations, and cash flows could be materially harmed.\n63.

Any domestic or international rating agencies’ downgrade of India’s debt rating could adversely affect\nour business.\nSeveral factors could lead to a downgrade of India's sovereign debt rating, including changes in tax or\nfiscal policies or a decrease in India's foreign exchange reserves, all of which are beyond our company's\ncontrol. Should international rating agencies revise India's creditworthiness for domestic or international\ndebt, it could significantly affect our ability to secure additional external financing and the terms of such\nfinancing, particularly from international markets.\nOur Company's ability to access debt capital markets and our cost of borrowing are heavily reliant on\nIndia’s credit ratings. As of recent assessments, India's sovereign credit rating was affirmed at Baa3 with\na “stable” outlook by Moody’s in August 2023 and affirmed as BBB- with a “stable” outlook by Fitch in\nJanuary 2024, and confirmed as BBB “low” by DBRS in May 2023. Additionally, S&P rated India’s\nlong-term sovereign credit as BBB- and short-term as A-3, both with a “stable” outlook. Any negative\nadjustments to these ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional financing on favourable terms,\nor any at all. Such a downgrade could be triggered by changes in the government’s tax or fiscal policies,\nover which we have no control. Such downgrade and consequently, our overall financial health may also\nbe. This may negatively impact our business operations, cash flow, financial condition, and the valuation\nof our Equity Shares.\n74. Indian law investment restrictions imposed on foreign investors may limit our ability to attract such\ninvestors, which can adversely impact the market price of our Equity Shares.\nCurrently, Indian foreign exchange regulations allow for the transfer of shares between non-residents\nand residents, provided they adhere to sector-specific norms, certain restrictions and meet the Reserve\nBank of India’s (“RBI”) pricing guidelines and reporting requirements. Should a share transfer not align\nwith these guidelines, requirements, or fall under specific exceptions, prior regulatory approval is\nnecessary. Moreover, foreign investments are generally permitted across various sectors of the Indian\neconomy without caps or the need for prior approvals, except where specifically restricted. However,\nforeign investors must comply with certain procedures prescribed for such investments. The RBI, along\nwith relevant ministries and departments, are responsible for such approvals.\nShareholders intending to convert the Rupee proceeds from the sale of shares into foreign currency and\nrepatriate it out of India must obtain either a no-objection certificate or a tax clearance certificate from\nthe Indian income tax authorities. This conversion is contingent upon the shares being held on a\nrepatriable basis and the sale being conducted in accordance with the pricing guidelines or with the\nnecessary regulatory approval for both the sale and the remittance of sale proceeds.\nAdditionally, as per the Press Note No. 3 (2020 Series) issued by the Department for Promotion of\nIndustry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) on April 17, 2020, investments from beneficial owners in\ncountries that share a land border with India are subject to government approval. This also applies to any\nchange in beneficial ownership of existing or future foreign direct investments in an Indian entity, which\nresults in the ownership falling under the aforementioned restrictions, necessitating the Government of\nIndia's approval. The Ministry of Finance further amended the FEMA Non-debt Instruments Rules on\nApril 22, 2020, to reflect this change. We cannot guarantee that the necessary approvals from the RBI or\nother government agencies will be granted under specific terms, conditions, or at all. For further\ninformation, see “Restrictions on Foreign Ownership of Indian Securities” beginning on page 498.\n75. Investors may have difficulty enforcing foreign judgements against us or our management.\nOur Company is incorporated under the laws of India and all of our Directors are residents of India. All\nof our Company’s assets are located in India. As a result, it may not be possible for investors outside of\nIndia to effect service of process on us or such persons from their respective jurisdictions outside of\nIndia, or to enforce against them judgements obtained in courts outside of India predicated upon our civil\nliabilities or our Directors under laws other than Indian Law.\nRecognition and enforcement of foreign judgements is provided for under Sections 13 and 44A of the\nCode of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”). India is not a party to any international treaties in relation to\nthe recognition or enforcement of foreign judgements. India has reciprocal recognition and enforcement\n80",

Such\nchanges, including the instances mentioned below, may adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, cash flows and future prospects, to the extent that we are unable to\nsuitably respond to and comply with any such changes in applicable law and policy. Adverse\nmodifications to, or changes in interpretations of, existing policies, laws, rules or regulations, or the\nintroduction of new statutes, rules or regulations (including those related to foreign investment and stamp\nduty) that govern our business activities could lead to our operations being considered as non-compliant\nor adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results. For example, regulatory authorities in\nIndia and abroad may introduce new rules or policies, or pass new legislations that impact EVs or the\nbroader automotive sector. Such circumstances could result in additional compliance obligations,\nnecessitating us to secure further approvals and licences from relevant government and regulatory\nagencies, who may impose stringent conditions. It could also cause uncertainty in our business practices,\npotentially disrupting our operations. Adapting to such changes could result in higher costs and additional\ndemands on our management and resources. Any lapses in compliance could negatively impact our\nbusiness operations, financial performance, cash flow, and growth prospects.\nAdditionally, the Government of India has introduced (a) the Code on Wages, 2019 (“Wages Code”);\n(b) the Code on Social Security, 2020 (“Social Security Code”); (c) the Occupational Safety, Health and\nWorking Conditions Code, 2020; and (d) the Industrial Relations Code, 2020 (collectively, the “Labour\nCodes”) which consolidate, subsume and replace numerous existing central labour legislations. The\nGovernment of India has postponed the enactment of the respective Labour Codes, and they shall come\ninto force from such dates as may be notified. It is possible that different provisions within the Labour\nCodes may come into effect at various times. While the rules for implementation under these codes have\nnot been notified in its entirety, as an immediate consequence, their introduction could potentially\nincrease our company's financial obligations, negatively affecting our profit margins. We have not yet\nfully assessed the impact that these or similar laws might have on our business operations, which could\npotentially limit our ability to expand in the future. For instance, the Social Security Code is designed to\nstandardise social security benefits for employees, which were previously divided under various acts\nwith differing scopes and coverage. Additionally, the Wages Code restricts the portion of wages that can\nbe excluded from calculations for employment benefits (such as gratuity and maternity benefits) to a\nmaximum of 50% of the total wages paid to employees. The enforcement of these laws could lead to\nhigher employee and labour costs, which in turn could have a detrimental effect on our operational\nresults, cash flow, business, and overall financial health.\nFurther, pursuant to the Finance (No.2) Act of 2024, notified on August 16, 2024, the Government of\nIndia has introduced new income tax slabs, an increase in standard deduction and an increase in the\ndeduction available in respect of private sector employer’s contribution to National Pension Scheme from\n10% to 14% of the salary of the concerned employees. There is no certainty on the impact of the full\nunion budget on tax laws or other regulations, which may adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations or on the industry in which we operate.\n69. Challenging economic conditions may affect consumer demand for new vehicles, particularly electric\nvehicles.\nEconomic conditions in India have a significant impact on our revenues and financial results as we derive\na majority of our revenues from India. Economic conditions in India are sensitive to global economic\nconditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived\noverall economic growth rate in India. Our revenue and profitability are strongly correlated to\ndiscretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions, unemployment\nlevels, the availability of discretionary income and consumer confidence. Recessionary economic cycles,\na protracted slowdown or worsening of the global or Indian economy, increased unemployment in India,\nrising interest rates or other industry-wide cost pressures could also affect consumer behaviour and lead\nto a decline in our sales and earnings. Discretionary consumer spending also is affected by other factors,\nincluding changes in tax rates and tax credits, interest rates and the availability and terms of consumer\ncredit. During future periods of economic weakness, we may experience a decline in the demand for our\nE2Ws, which could harm our business, prospects and operating results. Accordingly, any events that\nhave a negative effect on the Indian economy or on foreign economies or that negatively affect consumer\nconfidence in the economy, including disruptions in credit and stock markets, and actual or perceived\neconomic slowdowns, may harm our business, prospects and operating results.\n78",

Agreements between competitors that involve\nprice-fixing, limiting production or supply, market sharing, or any other activity that leads to bid-rigging\nor collusive bidding are typically assumed to adversely affect competition.

Indian financial markets could be subject to increased volatility due to financial instability in other\ncountries.\nOur business operations and primary market are predominantly concentrated in India, a country whose\neconomic landscape is affected by global market trends, especially those in emerging Asian economies.\nWhile each country's economic conditions are unique, investor sentiment in one country can negatively\nimpact the securities market in another. Historically, several Asian currencies have experienced\ndevaluation against the U.S. Dollar due to a variety of factors. A decline in investor confidence in the\nfinancial systems of other emerging markets could lead to heightened volatility in India's financial\nmarkets and indirectly affect the Indian economy in general. Global financial instability could also\nadversely influence the Indian economy, potentially affecting our business, future financial performance,\nand the value of our Equity Shares. Additionally, concerns about trade conflicts between major\neconomies could lead to greater risk aversion and volatility in the global capital markets, which may, in\nturn, impact the Indian economy.\nChina is one of India's significant trade partners, and any economic downturn in China or adverse\ndevelopments in the bilateral relationship could negatively affect trade between the two nations. Our\nCompany and our suppliers import certain components for E2Ws from China; therefore, any tension in\ntrade relations between India and China could disrupt the supply of these components. Such disruptions\ncould have a detrimental effect on our business operations, financial health, and operational results.\nThe global credit and equity markets have occasionally faced severe dislocations, liquidity issues, and\nmarket corrections. In response to these events, policymakers and regulators in various countries,\nincluding the United States and India, have enacted measures aimed at stabilising the financial markets.\nThe long-term effects of these legislative and regulatory actions on the global financial markets remain\nunclear, and may not achieve the desired effect of market stabilisation. Should the current challenges in\nthe global credit markets persist or if significant financial disruptions arise, these conditions could\nnegatively impact our business, future financial performance, and the trading price of our Equity Shares.\n71. Increase in Indian inflation may lead to increased costs and a decline in profits.\nWe may experience inflation volatility in India and continue to face historically persistent high inflation\nrates. Escalating inflation may increase interest rates and operational costs, including transportation,\nsalaries, and other business-related expenses, negatively impacting our financial health. Inflationary\npressures could also complicate cost estimation and management. Should operating expenses rise due to\ninflation, our inability to fully transfer these costs to customers could adversely affect our profitability\nand financial standing. Moreover, inflation-induced interest rate rises could slow economic growth and\ncredit expansion, further straining our financial performance. Our future success depends on our ability\nto increase revenue to counterbalance inflation-related cost hikes, failing which our business prospects,\nfinancial condition, operational results, and cash flow could suffer. Although the Government of India\nhas implemented measures to mitigate inflation, there can be no assurance that these measures remain\neffective.\n72. Events beyond our control such as natural disasters, fires, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, terrorist\nattacks and civil unrest could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business, financial condition, and operational results are susceptible to risks from natural disasters\nlike typhoons, droughts, floods, monsoons, earthquakes, and fires, as well as global health crises,\nincluding epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. Additionally, geopolitical conflicts, including\nthe Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Gaza unrest, acts of war, terrorism, civil disturbances, and economic\ninstability can materially disrupt our operations. These events, often beyond our control, may result in\nproperty repairs, personnel evacuation, or operational suspension. Geopolitical tensions, such as those\narising from conflicts between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Hamas, could lead to embargoes,\nairspace restrictions, or retaliatory actions against companies, with unpredictable impacts on our\nbusiness. Such incidents could hinder our production, disrupt our technology systems or platform, affect\nsales, and result in unforeseen expenses or delays, such as disruptions in our delivery schedule.\nConsequently, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\n79",

In addition,\nany adverse movement in currency exchange rates during a delay in repatriating the proceeds from a sale\nof Equity Shares outside India, for example, because of a delay in regulatory approvals that may be\nrequired for the sale of Equity Shares may reduce the proceeds received by Shareholders.

To further these objectives, SEBI and the\nStock Exchanges have introduced the ASM and GSM. These measures apply to the securities of\ncompanies based on a set of objective criteria, including significant fluctuations in price and trading\nvolume, high concentration of trading by certain client accounts, average delivery percentage, and\nsecurities experiencing unusual price increases that are not aligned with the company’s financial health\nand fundamentals, such as earnings, book value, fixed assets, net worth, price-to-earnings ratio, and\nmarket capitalisation.\nUpon listing, our Equity Shares will be subject to varying market conditions and other factors that could\nlead to substantial price volatility, low trading volumes, and a high concentration of trading by certain\nclient accounts. If any of these factors occur, or if other conditions arise, they may activate the thresholds\nset by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges for placing our securities under the ASM and/or GSM frameworks\nor other surveillance measures. This could lead to significant trading restrictions being imposed on our\nEquity Shares by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges. Such restrictions might include higher margin\nrequirements, trade-for-trade settlement without netting off, limitations on trading frequency, reduced\nprice bands, settlement on a gross basis or a freeze on the upper price limit during trading.

The actual deployment of funds shall be based\non our current business plan, internal management estimates, prevailing market conditions and other commercial\nand technical factors, including interest rates and other charges, and the financing and other agreements entered\ninto by our Company. We may have to revise our funding requirements and deployment from time to time on\naccount of various factors, such as, change in cost, financial and market conditions, demand for our products,\nchange in technology, our management’s analysis of economic trends and business requirements, competitive\nlandscape, ability to identify and consummate proposed investments as well as general factors affecting our results\nof operations, financial condition, access to capital, business and strategy and interest/exchange rate fluctuations\nor other external factors, which may not be within the control of our management. For further details, please see\n“Risk Factors –We are subject to risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations.” on page 75.\nIf the Net Proceeds are not utilized (in full or in part) for the Objects during the respective periods stated above\ndue to factors such as (i) the timing of completion of the Offer; (ii) market conditions outside the control of our\nCompany; and (iii) any other business and commercial considerations, the remaining Net Proceeds shall be\nutilized (in part or full) in subsequent periods as may be determined by our Company, in accordance with\napplicable laws. This may entail rescheduling the proposed utilization of the Net Proceeds and changing the\ndeployment of funds at the discretion of our management, subject to compliance with applicable laws. Further,\nour Company may decide to accelerate the estimated deployment of Net Proceeds ahead of the schedule of\nimplementation specified above. Any such change in our plans may require rescheduling of our expenditure\nprograms and increasing or decreasing expenditure for a particular Object vis-à-vis the utilization of Net Proceeds.\nDetails of the Objects\nI. Capital expenditure to be incurred by our Company for establishment of an E2W factory in\nMaharashtra, India\nAs per CRISIL Report, the E2W penetration is expected to increase to 35-40% by Fiscal 2031, from 5.1% in\nFiscal 2024. To cater to the growing demand of the segment, enable new product launches (scooters and\nmotorcycles) and to mitigate the critical supply chain risk around key manufacturing processes, we propose to\nconstruct a factory in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra, India at Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC),\nBIDKIN (“Factory 3.0”) with the approval of Maharashtra Industrial Township Limited (“MITL”). The Board\nof our Company pursuant to its resolution dated June 6, 2024 has approved the establishment of Factory 3.0.\nFactory 3.0 will be set up in two phases, of which Phase I of Factory 3.0 (“Project”) is proposed to be partly\nfinanced through the Net Proceeds. The Project is expected to commence production in May, 2026 in a phased\nmanner and be completed in full by March, 2027, with a production capacity of 0.5 million E2Ws per year, based\non the D&B Report. Factory 3.0 is expandable to a total production capacity of 1.00 million E2Ws per year upon\ncompletion of both phases (Source: D&B Report). Our Company proposes to invest an amount of ₹ 9,272 million\nin the Project, from the Net Proceeds.\nWe believe that spreading out our Hosur plant and Factory 3.0, each situated in different geographical areas in\nIndia, will enable us to alleviate some of the risks inherent in the manufacturing process, such as natural disasters,\nelectricity outages and labour disputes. For further details of such risks, please see “Risk Factors – We currently\ndepend on our Hosur Plant for the manufacturing and assembly of our electric two-wheelers and battery, and\nany disruptions to the operations of our Hosur Plant could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations” on page 47. According to the CRISIL Report, E2W penetration rate is high\nin West India and we therefore seek to leverage the location of Factory 3.0 in Maharashtra, and the strong\nautomotive supplier base in the region, to reduce cost of logistics and aim to reach customers faster.\nAt Factory 3.0, we plan to vertically integrate additional automation technologies and manufacturing lines for\nselected manufacturing processes such as transmission assembly, painting, and electronics assembly, that we\ncurrently outsource to third-party OEM manufacturers, in order to achieve greater cost efficiencies in our\nproduction process, enhance our control over the quality of our products, increase flexibility in introducing and\nmanaging variants and mitigate supply chain risk. Once we execute such manufacturing processes, in-house, we\nare also likely to achieve economies of scale and drive better operational efficiencies. This approach will also\nprovide us with greater agility in responding to changes in customer demand and greater resilience to supply\ndisruptions. In addition, we plan to manufacture our new scooter and motorcycle platforms at Factory 3.0, with a\nphased expansion plan, to ensure efficient capital utilisation.\n144",

The Ather 450 was the first E2W to offer features such as a touchscreen\ndashboard with navigation, internet connectivity, cloud integration and aluminium chassis, according to the\nCRISIL Report. The Ather 450 was also the first E2W to offer a top speed of 80 kmph comparable to ICE scooters,\naccording to the CRISIL Report. Following that, we launched the Ather 450X in January 2020, the Ather 450 X\n(Generation 3) in July 2022, the Ather 450 X (Generation 3.1) in January 2023, the Ather 450S in August 2023\nand the Ather 450 Apex in January 2024. With the Ather 450X, we improved the model’s performance with\nfeatures such as warp mode and Bluetooth-based features. The Ather 450X (Generation 3) introduced higher\ndriving range options and the Ather 450X (Generation 3.1) introduced more colour options in January 2023. The\nAther 450S, a more affordable model than the Ather 450X, featured the DeepView display on the dashboard. With\nthe Ather 450 Apex, we increased the 450 line’s acceleration and top speed specifications and introduced new\nfeatures, such as the Magic Twist, a ride feature that allows riders to utilise the vehicle’s throttle for electronic\nbraking regardless of the level of battery charge.\nThe Ather Rizta, launched in April 2024, is our first convenience scooter model featuring a large seat and safety\nfeatures such as SkidControl. With the introduction of each new EV model, we also leveraged our R&D and\ndesign capabilities to introduce new features and performance upgrades. The Ather Rizta utilises the battery,\npowertrain and software of the 450 platform while using a modified chassis and electronics platform. The various\nelements of the 450 platform are common building blocks that we can leverage to develop and manufacture\ndifferent products that cater to a variety of customer preferences.\nFurther, according to the CRISIL Report, we were the first two-wheeler (“2W”) OEM to establish a 2W fast\ncharging network, the Ather Grid, in India. Our software, the Atherstack, introduced industry-first connected\nfeatures such as Over-The-Air (“OTA”) updates and ride statistics on the Ather app. It had 64 features as at July\n31, 2024.\nHistorical R&D initiatives\nOur R&D initiatives in the last three Fiscal Years were towards the development of the existing 450 E2W platform\n(comprising battery, chassis, powertrain, software and electronics), a new battery platform and our in-house motor\ncontroller and low-cost smart dashboard, improvement of our powertrain, as well as various cost reduction\ninitiatives such as developing our in-house motor controller and belt transmission system. These efforts enabled\nlaunch of the Ather 450X, 450S, 450 Apex and Rizta products in the last three fiscals. We also designed and\ndeveloped charging infrastructure products such as the fast charger, the Ather neighbourhood charger and the\nAther Duo charger, which works as a fixed as well as portable charger.\nA few key R&D developments in the last three fiscals are elaborated below:\n(i) Design and development of new chassis for Ather Rizta: The Ather Rizta, launched in April 2024, is\nour first convenience scooter model. Our R&D initiatives in respect of Ather Rizta include redesign\nof our prior chassis and assembly line, design of new lamps, body panels and accessories, and tuning\nof our powertrain. This involved creating virtual simulations and testing multiple prototypes.\n(ii) Design and development of advanced versions of the Atherstack: The Atherstack is our software\nengine developed in-house that powers our EVs, charging infrastructure, accessories and mobile\napplications. The R&D efforts in respect of Atherstack in the last three fiscals have been focussed\non expansion of features through development of new firmware, algorithms, human machine\ninterface, applications and data platform. The Atherstack is crucial in enabling us to gain insight on\nusage patterns of customer cohorts that we analyse to further advance our vehicle features, quality\nand performance in line with evolving customer needs.\n(iii) Design and development of the Ather Drive Controller (“ADC”): The ADC is a motor controller\nmodule developed in-house to maintain control over the power delivery process. The design and\ndevelopment of ADC involved mechanical, electrical, assembly line design and software\ndevelopment through virtual simulations and testing of multiple prototypes. The ADC has enabled\nus to deliver features such as the MagicTwist, which allows for electronic braking from 0% to 100%\nof the battery state of charge, the Smart-Eco mode, which dynamically adjusts power delivery to\nensure a longer driving range and SkidControl which adjusts torque to the rear wheel to prevent\nskidding, commonly known as traction control.\n157",

Electrification of 2Ws has brought about innovative\nfeatures and a better total cost of ownership (“TCO”) as compared to ICE vehicles, and consequently, E2W\npenetration has risen to 5.1% in Fiscal 2024 and is expected to increase to 35-40% by Fiscal 2031, according to\nthe CRISIL Report.\nWe believe we will continue to require sustained investment in R&D activities to stay competitive and improve\nour products. As we seek to foray into more segments of the electric scooter market and venture into the electric\nmotorcycle market, we will require a wider portfolio of products to penetrate well into the market in India and\nother countries. For instance, the motorcycle market in India has seen low EV penetration according to the CRISIL\nReport and therefore presents an opportunity for a product that can drive EV penetration. Such products may\nrequire sustained R&D efforts to be able to effectively address customer requirements. Additionally, we will work\non leveraging technological advancements across various platforms such as powertrain, battery and software and\nelectronics in our products to make our products more appealing to customers while improving our unit\neconomics.\nIn addition to our current R&D focus areas, we propose to continue investing in R&D and focusing on aspects\nthat will contribute towards quality improvement, economies of scale, cost reductions and lower supply chain\ndependencies, and enhance overall user experience in respect of our products, which include, among others:\n(i) Design and development of battery packs and battery management systems for our proposed\nmotorcycle platform, and adoption of new battery platform based on alternative chemistries for our\nexisting product portfolio;\n(ii) Design and development of powertrains for our proposed new scooter and motorcycle platforms,\nand exploring rare-earth free and heavy rare-earth free motor technologies;\n(iii) Design and development of chassis for our proposed new scooter and motorcycle platforms,\nincluding body panels and peripheral components;\n159",

Investments, a key factor that boosts growth, are expected to moderate as the\ngovernment focuses on fiscal consolidation. The extent of revival in private investment cycle will determine the\ninvestment momentum this fiscal. The transmission of past rate hikes by the RBI to the broader lending rates\ncontinues. Rising borrowing costs and regulatory measures to clamp down risky lending could moderate domestic\ndemand in the current fiscal. On the other hand, another spell of normal monsoon and easing inflation can revive\nrural demand, which was a laggard in the country's growth story last year.\nAs per CRISIL MI&A, the fiscal 2025 seems to have started on a good note, merchandise exports registering\ngrowth in the first quarter of FY2025.\nIndia ranks as the world’s 5th largest economy and is the fastest growing among major economies.

This\nwould peg India as a lower middle-income country as per World Bank. According to the International Monetary\nFund’s estimates, India’s per capita income (at current prices) is expected to grow at 9.4% CAGR over CY2024\nto 2029.\nAt the macroeconomic level, the rise in per capita income implies that as incomes increase, the proportion of\nexpenditure allocated to discretionary items such as consumer durables and automobiles will increase. This will\nlead to a qualitative enhancement in consumption patterns, characterized by a growing demand for discretionary\ngoods. Further improvement in the per capita income will expand the 2W penetration going ahead.\nRising 2W penetration in India\nTwo-wheelers stand as a vital and easily accessible mode of transportation across both urban and rural areas of\nIndia. Among them, motorcycles hold the highest popularity, trailed by scooters and mopeds. While the presence\nof mopeds in the two-wheeler inventory is declining, the prevalence of scooters is experiencing a notable surge.\nAcross India, the primary use of two-wheelers among owners is for commuting to their workplaces. Additionally,\nbusiness-related activities constitute the second-largest segment in the two-wheeler market, with delivery services\nfor food, goods, as well as mail and courier services, extensively relying on two-wheelers. Some of the key drivers\nsupporting the growth of the two-wheeler industry are the rise in per capita income, improving infrastructure,\nurbanization, and worsening traffic congestion etc. Indian two-wheeler penetration per 1000 people had been\naround 106-108 in FY19 which rose upto around 116-118 in FY24.\nAccording to PRICE, two-wheelers are considered as a choice of transportation for Aspirer and Middle-Class\nhouseholds. Among Destitute households, 63% own a bicycle, but nearly 34% possess a two-wheeler, such as a\nmoped, motorcycle, or scooter. This ownership rises to 47% for Aspirer households and 70% for Middle-Class\nhouseholds. Even among Rich households, 75% own a two-wheeler, typically a luxury two-wheeler, compared to\nthe 100% that own a car.\n185",

            "page_content": "Drivers for India’s Economic Growth\n● Capital will continue to be the biggest contributor to growth. As the government pursues fiscal\nconsolidation, its role in boosting overall capex will partly diminish compared with the past few years.\n● Strong domestic demand is expected to drive India’s growth over peers in the medium term.\n● Investment prospects are optimistic, given the government’s capex push, progress of Production-Linked\nIncentive (PLI) scheme, healthier corporate balance sheets, and a well-capitalised banking sector with\nlow non-performing assets (NPAs).\n● India is also likely to benefit from its diversification of the supply chain for incoming FDI flows, as\nglobal supply chains get reconfigured with focus shifting from efficiency towards resilience and friend\nshoring.\n● Rising employment rates and a notable increase in private consumption, buoyed by growing consumer\nconfidence, are poised to drive GDP growth in the upcoming months.\n● The government's future capital expenditures are expected to be supported by factors such as tax\nbuoyancy, simplified tax structures with lower rates, tariff structure reassessment, and tax filing\ndigitization.\n● Medium-term growth is anticipated to be bolstered by increased capital spending on infrastructure and\nasset development projects, leading to enhanced growth multipliers.\nIndia’s Demographic Advantage and its impact on 2Ws\nIndia’s population surpassed China’s by a slight margin in CY2023, making it the most populous country with\n1.4billion (140 crores) people as per UNFPA’s State of World Population Report 2023. According to the report,\n25% of India’s total population is between 0-14 years, 68% is between the ages of 15 and 64 years, which is\nconsidered the working population of a country, and 7% above 65 years. Apart from this, about 18% of the\npopulation is between 10-19 years of age, and 26% are between 10-24 years (Generation Z). People under the age\nof 25 years currently account for more than 40% of the population.\nIndia’s median age is about 28 years, and it has largest working population among major global economies. It is\nexpected to add ~70 million to the workforce (15-64 age group) by 2030. This benefit allows greater engagement\nin productive labor, thus bolstering national income. India's youthful demographic not only strengthens the\ncountry's competitive edge in the services and manufacturing sectors but also unlocks the spending potential of a\nyoung population towards discretionary expenses.\nThe working/young population has significantly impacted India’s growth in past few years majorly in the IT,\nmanufacturing, and service sectors. This is in line with past progress of economies like Japan and China where\nthe young population has fueled economic development.

            "page_content": "Robust 2W Replacement Demand - Shift from 2W to 4W Takes Time\nThe Indian domestic passenger vehicle industry has witnessed a healthy 5% CAGR growth in the last five years\nbacked by improvement in macroeconomic scenario, portfolio expansion by players, ironing out of vehicle supply\nconcerns coupled with rising traction for UVs. However, rising PV industry did not have any sizeable impact on\nthe two-wheeler industry sales.\nAlthough there is a typical upgradation done by entry segment customers from two-wheelers to passenger vehicles\n(especially compact hatchbacks), the sharp rise in passenger vehicle prices in the last 5 years has restricted the\nshift towards the passenger vehicles segment. The income of this customer segment has also been impacted\nsignificantly amidst the pandemic. Moreover, the rise in interest expense & fuel costs, in turn the overall operating\nexpenses, was another factor disincentivizing the upgrade from two-wheelers to passenger vehicles.\nThus, the significant increase in passenger vehicle ownership costs, and pressure on income levels for this\ncustomer segment, has limited the replacement of the two-wheeler with an entry level passenger vehicle in the\nlast 5 years. Even going ahead, given the sizeable price difference between the <=110cc motorcycle and an entry\nlevel / compact hatchback, the replacement of the two-wheeler with a car by the entry level customer base, is\nexpected to be limited. Therefore, it is imperative that such customers, when in a position to upgrade their two-\nwheeler, prefer a >=125cc two-wheeler as compared to what they own.\nOn the other hand, for the financially stable, affluent customers who already own a >=125cc motorcycle or scooter,\na car is usually an additional vehicle purchase. There is also a scenario of >=125cc scooter or motorcycle being\npurchased for usage by non-car driving family members. For such customers, usage scenarios of two-wheeler and\nthe passenger vehicle are different. They do not replace the two-wheeler with a passenger vehicle and prefer to\nown both simultaneously. Both also undergo their own individual replacement cycles.\nThus, the replacement demand for two-wheelers is expected to remain strong despite the rise in passenger vehicle\nindustry sales.\nNeed for Electrification in India\nRising Air Pollution in India and Air Quality Impact of 2Ws\nAir pollution has become a growing concern in India, especially in the urban centers, and the government has\nadopted various strategies to mitigate the same. The government is aligning themselves in accordance with the\nglobal climate related policies and standards to improve the air quality in the country. As per World Air Quality\nReport 2023, India ranked as the world’s third most polluted country with an average annual PM2.5 concentration\nof 54.4 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m³). Also, 9 out of the top 10 polluted cities in the world were from India.\nAccording to Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), air pollution shortens average Indian life expectancy by 5.9 years.\nAround 136 million Indians (96% of the Indian population) face PM2.5 concentrations that are seven times higher\nthan the World Health Organization's recommended levels of 5 (μg/m³).\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), road transport presently accounts for 12% of India’s energy-\nrelated CO2 emission and is currently responsible for 20-30% of urban air pollution.\nTo address this issue, the government has implemented stringent emission regulations for vehicles including two-\nwheelers, aimed at reducing harmful pollutants and promoting sustainable mobility by moving towards\nelectrification. In India, two-wheelers are a common mode of transportation and contribute significantly to air\npollution. Also, two-wheelers continue to dominate India’s vehicle fleet.\nRise in Fuel Prices in India\nThe two-wheeler industry is sensitive to fuel price fluctuations and consumers are cautious about total cost of\nownership (TCO). The increase in fuel prices could result in higher fuel related expenses thereby elevating the\nTCO. Also, an increase or decrease in fuel prices is likely to affect consumer sentiments and may lead to slow\ndown or pickup in purchase decisions.\n186",

Customers are\nlooking to upgrade to the next premium vehicle segment within motorcycles as well as scooters. Younger buyer\nprofiles, new vehicles with attractive features launched at competitive rates and increasing financing support have\nsupported this premiumization trend within the two-wheeler industry. In the last 5 years, as per CRISIL MI&A’s\nestimates, the share of >=125cc motorcycles increased from ~38% in fiscal 2019 to ~52% in fiscal 2024. While\nfor scooters, the share of >=125cc scooters is estimated to have risen from ~20% in fiscal 2019 to ~47% in fiscal\n2024. A relatively price agnostic customer base, feature rich vehicles and young buyers that prefer high\nperformance and advanced features have led to a premiumization trend in scooters.\nA similar premiumization trend is being witnessed in other industries as well. Within the consumer durable\nindustry, there is clear customer shift towards the premium larger panel TVs. According to CRISIL Research, the\nshare of large size panel TV (>32 inch) has increased from 15-20% in fiscal 2017 to an estimated 45-50% in fiscal\n2023. Even in washing machines, the premium fully automatic washing machines have been growing at a faster\nrate compared to semi-automatic washing machines signaling the customer shift towards the premium products.\nSimilarly in the automobile space, the passenger vehicle PV segment is seeing a noteworthy premiumization trend.\nIn fact, the share of relatively premium PVs – Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) has increased from 29% in fiscal\n2019 to 60% in fiscal 2024. The traction for these feature rich connected vehicles has been on the rise, especially\nfrom the young customer base, and is expected to continue going ahead.\nThus, this growth of premium products – premiumization trend – has taken over multiple industries including the\ntwo-wheeler industry. Over the long-term horizon, CRISIL MI&A expects the premiumization trend to drive the\noverall sales in the 2W industry.\nElectrification in the 2W industry\nEV sales have grown, especially post pandemic aided by the rising awareness, government support and expanding\nEV portfolio of the industry.

Additionally, the E2W\nportfolio is expanding with technology-rich vehicles that are being launched at competitive rates, which is driving\nconsumer interest and growth of E2Ws in India. Significant strides in product evolution are one of the primary\nreasons for the sharp growth witnessed in the E2W segment in India.\nEvolution of E2W offerings\nElectrification in the two-wheelers industry started with low-speed electric two-wheelers. These low-speed\nelectric vehicles had a much smaller battery and a speed limit of about 25 kmph.\nThe real push to electrification in the two-wheelers industry came from the launch of high-speed electric two-\nwheelers (speed >25kmph). These electric vehicles were comparable to their ICE counterparts in terms of power\nas well as speed. The organised nature of the high-speed electric two-wheelers industry also provided authenticity\nand trust to the E2W segment. Further, in 2018 Ather Energy launched the country’s first smart electric scooter\nwith features like touchscreen dashboard, connectivity features via 3G sim card and onboard navigation.\nImproved battery chemistry and development of associated software technology is further aiding fast charging\ncapability of the latest EVs. Software enablement in motor controllers as well as battery management systems\nhave supported improvement in vehicle efficiency as well.\nThese technological advancements have helped EV OEMs address one of the primary concerns regarding the\nusage of EVs – the range anxiety. In fact, the high-speed electric vehicles launched around fiscal 2018 had a\nrelatively limited range of about 60-75km per charge. In the next 6 years, the range has nearly doubled to 100-\n150km per charge.\nAdditionally, over the years, OEMs have also introduced high performance e-scooters which offer maximum\nspeed of more than 80 km/hr like Ather 450 series, Ola S1 Pro, TVS X etc, to cater to customers who value power\nand performance.\n196\n\n[TABLES]\n| Segment |  |  | FY19-FY24 CAGR |  |  | FY24-FY31P CAGR |",

The shortened replacement cycle for the average customer is an added boost for the two-wheeler industry\nsales.\nAccessories lending further support to OEM topline and the bottom line\nOver the years, traditional ICE 2W OEMs have expanded their consumer offerings with company branded\naccessories and merchandise like side mirrors, vehicle covers, seat covers, handlebar pads, engine guard, backrest,\nhelmets, apparels, gloves etc. Such branded accessories form an integral part of the two-wheeler industry. For the\npremium models / brands, merchandising has also been actively promoted as a means to drive brand image and\nbuild long term loyalty by developing a sense of community (for example Royal Enfield). The revenues from\nsales of accessories & merchandise, along with those from sale of parts and spares, typically contribute ~10-15%\nof the overall revenues for the traditional ICE 2W OEMs.\nIn line with the ICE 2W players, the new age EV players have also entered the accessories and merchandise space\nand are providing some of the traditional accessories like vehicle cover, seat covers, floor mats, sidestep, t-shirts\nand helmets. However, they have also started to offer technologically advanced accessories for their customers\nincluding smart helmets, portable chargers, fast chargers, electronic tyre inflators, pressure monitors etc. These\nadvanced accessories are sold at a premium over the general accessories as they have technology integrations that\ncater specifically to the E2W customer. Going forward, the demand for such accessories is expected to rise along\nwith the growth of the overall E2W industry.\nThese accessories and merchandise products are high gross margin (25-30%) products for the OEMs which not\nonly promote the brand but also provide an added support to the company top line as well as bottom line.\nAdvancement in Vehicle Technology\nOver the years, there has been a significant advancement in vehicle technology as well as addition of latest features\nin ICE as well as EVs, making the vehicles more appealing to the customers, especially the younger buyers. EV\nsegment has revolutionised the industry in terms of latest technological designs as well as offerings, and ICE\nvehicles are following with notable advancements.\nIn recent two-wheelers, features such as digital instrument cluster (around 2010), navigation (around 2017), USB\ncharging port (2017), Bluetooth connectivity (2018), cruise control have been added over the years. Over and\nabove these basic features, premium vehicles including EVs offer much advanced features like full colour TFT\ndisplays, gear shift indicators, real time mileage, fuel efficiency metrics, music, calls on vehicle display, riding\nmodes, traction control, keyless ignition, smart helmets with built in communication, etc.\nAs technology continues to advance, two-wheeler industry will witness more innovations in the coming years,\nmaking the ride safer and more enjoyable for the customer, thereby supporting the growth of industry over the\nlong-term horizon.\nDomestic Two-Wheeler Industry Outlook (fiscals 2025 to 2031)\nThe industry is expected to continue its growth momentum over the long-term horizon led by the positive\nmicroeconomic and macroeconomic environment, favourable rural demand, premiumization, intermittent\nlaunches, shrinking replacement cycle and continued support from financers. Moreover, continued R&D\ninvestments by the OEMs and the technological advancements in the industry to provide an added support to the\ngrowth of the industry over the long-term horizon.\nAdditionally, the fast-rising EV segment, with EV portfolio expansion by legacy players, capacity expansion by\nnew age players will accelerate the industry growth.\nIntroduction of CNG powertrain motorcycle by Bajaj, which will offer lower operating costs compared to petrol\nvariants, will push the two-wheeler industry growth further.\n194",

However, over the years, the competition has\nintensified within the industry, especially, with the entry of new age players in the electric scooter segment like\nOla, Ather, Okinawa and Ampere catering to the fast-expanding segment of EVs.\nThe E2W segment has been highly concentrated with a few players primarily catering to the entire segment.\nDuring fiscal 2019, a few OEMs like Hero Electric and Okinawa completely dominated the market with more\nthan 80% of the market share. Over the years, with the entry of new players, EV launches from legacy ICE OEMs\nas well as expansion in EV portfolio of players, competition intensified within the EV space.\nHigh speed vehicles offered initially by Hero Electric and Okinawa offered relatively lower speed and acceleration\ncompared to the ICE counterparts. Ather Energy entered the market in fiscal 2019 with its 450 model which\noffered comparable power and acceleration as an ICE vehicle along with internet connectivity and “smart”\nfeatures. This helped Ather achieve ~11% market share in fiscal 2020 and they have managed to maintain that\nshare through multiple updates to the Ather 450 line, despite the intensifying competition in the next 4 years.\nAther with its 450 line of scooters had a 11.5% market share in fiscal 2024. It is the third largest E2W manufacturer\nin India by sales market share, after Ola and TVS, as of fiscal 2024. Intermittent launches, technology rich\nproducts, expansion in retail network and development of the overall E2W ecosystem has helped the company\nmaintain its momentum in the market.\nOla entered the EV market in fiscal 2022 and expanded its presence at a very fast pace and became the leading\ncontributor to EV retails in India. Expansion in product portfolio and distribution network thrusted the contribution\nof Ola in E2W market. As of fiscal 2024, Ola has the market leadership in E2W sales with a share of 35.1%.\nThe legacy OEMs have also entered the EV space. TVS introduced the iQube model in fiscal 2020, and has\ngradually increased its supply over the years. It’s model iQube received healthy traction helping them clock second\nhighest retails during fiscal 2024.\nBajaj’s Chetak EV was introduced in Q4 of fiscal 2019. The company gradually expanded its presence across the\ncountry in the next few years. With increased company focus, coverage expansion and higher production, the\ncompany’s share increased to nearly 11% in fiscal 2024.\nAmpere entered the market in fiscal 2020 and gradually expanded its presence in the E2W space.

In June 2021, demand incentive for 2Ws was increased to INR\n15,000/ kWh from INR 10,000/kWh incentive given earlier. This heightened FAME incentive coupled with\nexpansion in vehicle portfolio by players as well as entry of Ola provided an additional thrust to the E2W retails\nin fiscal 2022.\nAdditionally, ICE vehicles witnessed a steep rise in prices in fiscal 2021 due to the BSVI implementation and a\nfurther hike during fiscal 2022 amidst the hike in raw material prices. This price hike was much higher than the\nnormal 3-4% annual hike undertaken by the industry. Over and above, this increase in vehicle acquisition costs,\nthe sharp rise in petrol prices (petrol prices crossing INR 100 mark) during the year provided an additional\nincentive to customers to shift from ICE vehicles to E2Ws. During fiscal 2022, amidst the much severe Covid\nsecond wave, pressure on incomes and increased medical expenses; limiting other expenses was a priority for\nmost of the customer base.\nThus, the increased subsidy on E2W, vehicle portfolio expansion coupled with increased acquisition and operating\ncosts of ICE 2Ws led to the sharp growth in E2W retails during fiscal 2022. E2W retails rose 5.6x from 45k in\nfiscal 2021 to 253k in fiscal 2022.\nGrowth momentum continued for the E2W segment in fiscal 2023. During the year, sharp push from new age EV\nplayers supported the growth in E2W. The legacy OEMs also scaled up their EV production, providing an added\npush to the EV retails during the year.\nFiscal 2024 began on a very strong growth trajectory. However, On June 1, 2023, the government reduced the\nFAME subsidy incentive cap from 40% of a vehicle's value to 15% and capped the subsidy at INR 10,000 per\nkWh of battery from INR 15,000 per kWh earlier. Due to this, manufacturers have had to increase the prices of\nelectric scooters, which led to a 57% sequential slowdown in sales in June. This sharp sequential contraction was\non an elevated base of May 2023, where sizeable pre buying was done by the customers due to the price rise from\nJune.\nState wise two-wheeler sales and EV penetration for fiscal 2024\nThe below graph showcases E2W penetration and E2W sales by states.

The scheme has further been extended for two months, till\nSeptember 2024.The scheme is aimed at providing incentives for the purchase of E2Ws and E3Ws in the country.\nThe scheme would support the adoption of 372,215 EVs in total, including 333,387 E2Ws and 38,828 E3Ws. The\ntargeted E3Ws include 13,590 e-rickshaws and e-carts, and 25,238 E3Ws in the L5 category. Under the FAME-\nII scheme, PMP was implemented, and manufacturers were obligated to follow the PMP guidelines outlining the\nlocalization of EV components over time.

The plan is to establish five lakh public charging stations (PCS) by 2025, by offering financial assistance\nto states and private companies. This initiative addresses the lack of charging infrastructure which is a key barrier\nto EV adoption. Further through the revised guidelines and standards for charging infrastructure issued by\nMinistry of Power, the government aims to augment the station density/distance between two charging stations as\nbelow:\n• At least one charging station to be made available in a grid of three-by-three km. Further one charging\nstation to be set up at every 25 km on both side of highway/roads.\n• For long range and heavy duty EVs, there should be one fast charging station at every 100 km, one on\neach side of the road/highway\nPolicies towards battery recycling\nBattery Waste Management Rules 2022 was implemented by the Government to promote the re-use and recycling\nof Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) batteries. This policy has set out the government’s vision for battery recycling\nin India, including the provision of financial incentives, the development of standards, and raising of awareness\nabout the importance of battery recycling. The traditional EV battery value chain includes raw material extraction,\nbattery manufacturing followed by first life application and finally disposal. However, battery re-use and recycle\nwill introduce alternate value chain where batteries are re-purposed for a second life application in the energy-\nstorage segment. Finally, in the end-of-life stage where the battery no longer meets its performance requirements,\nit is recycled for extraction of metals like Co, Ni, Al, Cu, etc. The introduction of re-use and recycle policy of\nACC batteries would help to reduce the battery prices further and improve availability of raw materials in the\nfuture.\nVehicle Scrappage\nThe scrappage policy envisages the phasing out of old passenger and commercial vehicles.

The number of modules and cells would depend on the size of the\nbattery pack.\nBattery Chemistry\nBattery chemistry plays a key role in delivering optimal performance in automotive applications. India compared\nto developed markets, has a different climate, terrain and driving conditions and hence demands a chemistry that\nis best in terms of reliability, safety, and performance. Further, an ideal battery chemistry should offer higher\nenergy density, long cycle life, and fast charging capability. The five large-scale commercialized chemistries are\nLCO, LMO, LFP, NMC, and NCA. The most common versions of lithium-ion batteries that have proven to be\nthe most suitable and viable for automobiles in India are LFP, NMC and NCA.\nElectric two-wheelers with high range require high energy density, hence Nickel based chemistries are dominant\npresently. While LFP has a longer cycle life and lower cost, it has a lower energy density. The cost of LFP battery\npacks is lower than NMC/NCA battery packs. In 2023, LFP battery packs were 15-23% cheaper than NMC battery\npacks.\nLFP is a less mineral intensive chemistry (need of critical raw materials like Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt, and\nManganese is lower), hence it would help OEMs to overcome the supply chain challenges rising from the supply\nshortage of critical raw materials. LFP battery production has a lower environmental impact as compared to NMC\nbatteries.\nWith more vehicles being introduced in the market at lower price points, LFP with its lower cost and less risky\nsupply chain is anticipated to be used more widely in E2Ws. For instance, the recently launched Ampere Nexus\ne-scooter utilizes an LFP battery.\nSupply Chain\nBattery supply chain involves six major manufacturing stages where multiple components are assembled to create\na battery pack. These six stages are cathode manufacturing, anode manufacturing, electrolyte, separator, cell\nassembly and battery pack assembly. Under each of these stages, multiple operations are performed including\nmining, refining, and processing. Multiple stakeholders like mining companies, refineries, cell component\nmanufacturers, cell manufacturers, suppliers and OEMs are involved in the EV battery supply chain, making it\ncomplex and extensive.\nThe value addition of each manufacturing stage in the supply chain is different. Industry estimates show that\nbattery cells, including materials and manufacturing, account for almost 70%-80% of the total cost of a battery\npack. The assembly of the cells into a complete battery pack accounts for the remaining 20%-30% of the total\ncost.\nThe current capability in India is restricted to pack assembly. However, with the advent of gigafactories in India,\nthe cell production capability will be established going forward. Creating gigafactories for cell production is a\n211",

The most value is captured in cathode and anode material\nmanufacturing. In this stage, raw materials contribute significantly to the overall manufacturing process. This\nmakes the extraction and processing of battery minerals a highly strategic sector.\nAccess to critical minerals like lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese is imperative for India to localize EV value\nchain, and this is a major challenge for cathode/anode manufacturing in India. Lithium is used in all existing\nbattery chemistries and India is import dependent for this mineral. Although India recently discovered lithium\ndeposits in the country, the commissioning of mines and extraction might be a long way away for India.\nWhile cell manufacturing is still in nascent stages in India, with the establishment of gigafactories under PLI ACC\nthis is expected to pick up. During that time access to raw material (cathode and anode minerals) could become a\nmajor potential obstacle, when cell manufacturing is expected to be ramped up to a higher capacity and higher\nlocal content percentages would be required. Thus, ensuring access to raw materials will become increasingly\nimportant and de-risking strategies should be in place to mitigate any potential supply chain disruption. Raw\nmaterials contribute significantly to cell production cost by over 60%. Because India being import dependent for\nmany of the raw materials, future gigafactories may face pricing pressures from raw material suppliers and EV\nmanufacturers.\nThe government through various schemes including PLI ACC, FAME, PMP is aiming to bolster the local EV\nbattery manufacturing supply chain. This had provided an impetus for domestic OEMs and suppliers to set up a\nbattery manufacturing plant in the country. In the first round of PLI ACC, a total of 30 GWh were awarded to\nRajesh Exports (5 GWh), Ola Electric Mobility (20 GWh), and Reliance New Energy (5 GWh) in 2022 for setting\nup battery manufacturing plant in India.\nScale is crucial to make economics work for cell manufacturing\nDemand potential is a key factor for cell manufacturers. This guaranteed demand is essential in capital-intensive\nprojects, such as gigafactories for cell manufacturing and cathode manufacturing plants. Further guaranteed\nofftake is a key metric to gain access to private capital. Across the battery supply chain, access to private markets\nand capital is essential, given the high upfront capital required, including R&D and technology costs in the battery\nbusiness. For example, Tata is planning to build a 40GW battery cell gigafactory in the United Kingdom (UK)\nwith an investment over £4 billion ($5.2 billion) to supply EV batteries for their luxury passenger vehicle arm,\nJLR. European battery cell manufacturer ACC (Automotive Cells Company), a joint venture between Stellantis,\nMercedes Benz and Total Energies, has raised €4.4 billion (USD$4.7 billion) in February 2024, aimed at\nsupporting the construction of three gigafactories for lithium-ion battery cell production in France, Germany, and\nItaly.

            "page_content": "With many Indian OEMs and suppliers venturing into battery cell production, the scale of manufacturing will be\na critical factor impacting profitability. In addition to that raw material availability and its pricing will also impact\nprofitability.\nPureplay battery suppliers like CATL and Samsung SDI had a net profit margin in 9-11% range. EV OEMs like\nTesla and BYD have a positive net margin, however, most of their revenue comes from automotive vehicle related\nbusiness. Other battery suppliers including LG Energy Solutions, CALB and Gotion have a net profit margin in\nthe range of 1-4%. This indicates that scale of manufacturing is amongst the key factors which impact profitability\nof cell manufacturing apart from pricing and other supply chain related parameters.\nGoing forward, India will need approximately 40-45 GWh battery capacity for E2Ws by fiscal 2031. Depending\non the battery technology chosen, the capex required to install 1GWh of battery capacity can range between USD\n60 to 100 million.\nSuccess in EVs\nTechnology (Vertical integration/design control of key components)\nTraditionally, companies have relied on multiple suppliers for raw material, technology and components. A\nvertically integrated approach refers to taking ownership of the technology of key components and software of\nthe vehicle. Alternatively, it can also refer to taking ownership of multiple steps in the supply chain and integrating\nthem into the business. Vertical integration involves taking greater control of upstream or downstream operations\nby developing internal expertise or through acquisitions of capabilities which were traditionally being outsourced.\nHowever, vertical integration requires higher expenditure to build capabilities in-house and not all the components\nor in-house processes can drive higher return-on-investment (ROI).\nBelow are a few advantages of vertical integration:\n• Control of the supply chain: Vertical integration gives a company control over the design and\nmanufacturing process. It can reduce its reliance on external suppliers by owning and controlling certain\naspects of the overall process. This also speeds up the creation of a new product as dependencies on\nexternal stakeholders are reduced and helps them to meet the changing demands of their customers. It\ngives companies a competitive edge over their competitors as well as manage costs and time to market.\n• Lower unit costs: It allows the company to control the design hence reducing wastes that occur due to\nstandard designs for multiple customers.\n• Control of user experience: Vertical integration of the design enables companies to better control the user\nexperience offered by the product as the number of interfaces that have to be managed with external\nsuppliers are fewer.\n• Faster time to market: This approach enables OEMs to introduce technological advancements in the\nmarket at an accelerated pace.\n• Better coordination: Through vertical integration, companies can monitor, manage, and control the various\noperations within their supply chain.\nSoftware capabilities and revenue stream\nSoftware has been a key driver for EV adoption, and it enabled confidence among the EV riders where they can\nbe sure of the statistics and condition of the underlying technology so that they can take decisions regarding their\nride accordingly. Further software opened possibilities of connectivity, smartphone integration and LTE services\nwhich augmented the riding experience. For example, an ICE scooter still uses turn-by-turn navigation which is\nenabled through smartphone, whereas EV scooters have in-built navigation and access to Google Maps. While\nsoftware is used to some extent in ICE vehicles to control the engine functionalities, these are not interactive, or\nrider enabled. In EVs, riders can choose their driving mode based on the required performance.\nRevenue stream in traditional automotive business were through vehicles sales, accessory sales, and aftermarket.\nWith vehicles being electric and software driven, the OEMs have identified recurring revenue opportunities in the\nsoftware side through selling customer experiences by monetizing certain features and functionality in a vehicle.\nSoftware which enables features and functionality in EVs are now becoming a key revenue stream for OEMs.\nSoftware offers potential to OEMs are introducing various business models to monetize the software opportunity\nthrough subscription, pay-per-use and one time purchase models.\n213",

India has witnessed notable\nadvancements and strategic transitions aimed at creating a self-sufficient semiconductor ecosystem, through\nsubstantial governmental support, strategic collaborations on an international scale, and an emphasis on\nconstructing a holistic ecosystem.\nUnit economics and cash burn rate\nCash burn is a common phenomenon in the pre-scaling stage of new age companies. Cash burn refers to the\nsituation where the company is spending more money than it is generating. In the pre-scaling stage, companies\nare typically focused on developing their products, building capabilities, establishing their brand and may also\nneed to invest heavily in infrastructure such as manufacturing equipment as well as hiring employees. These\ninvestments are essential for future growth and may result in negative cash flow over a period of time. Eventually\nthe cash burn rate reduces as companies become EBITDA positive. Factors such as COGS, capital expenses, and\noperational expenses can impact cash burn.\nPositive unit economics is a crucial success factor for reducing cash burn and sustaining an EV manufacturing\nbusiness. By producing and selling a large number of EVs at healthy margins, manufacturers can reduce their unit\ncosts and improve their unit economics. Vehicle prices and cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle can have a\nsignificant impact on unit economics.\nTesla is a one of the notable examples of a pure play EV company transitioning from a cash burn phase to\nprofitability. Tesla has focused on reducing unit costs per vehicle and has continued to do so even after achieving\nprofitability. However, prior to being profitable, Tesla had a phase of cash burn. A similar phenomenon is being\nobserved for EV manufacturing in India, more evidently in the pure play EV players who are currently in the cash\nburn phase.\nThe below figures indicate that the cash burn occurs in the pre-scaling stages.

            "page_content": "One of the major hurdles in adoption of EVs in India is the unavailability and slow development of public\ncharging infrastructure. While E2Ws are sold with dedicated personal chargers, currently India has\nlimited public charging infrastructure which poses a threat to mass scale adoption of EVs in the country.\nThis is primarily because of range anxiety and anxiety of being unable to find a functional charger in\ncase of sudden need\n• Policy Uncertainty\nCentral policies like FAME and EMPS, and state wise subsidies, still have a direct impact on the electric\nvehicle sales in India. Uncertainty around these policies greatly influence E2W retails on a regular basis\nand absence of subsidies have impacted their retails in the past. While the current EMPS scheme has\nbeen extended by two more months, a long-term solution is awaited. Also, it is unknown as to when\ncustomer buying will become stable in the absence of any kind of subsidies.\n• Network Spread\nCurrently E2Ws are present at much lesser number of outlets as compared to ICE 2Ws in India. The\nnumber of customer touchpoints, both of sales as well as service, that cater to E2Ws, have a much\nrestricted geographical spread as compared to ICE 2Ws. While the OEMs are actively expanding their\ndealer networks for selling and servicing E2Ws, it will be a few years before they are able to match up\nthe scale of the existing ICE 2W network. This could act as a barrier to adoption as customers might be\nvary of purchasing an E2W due to uncertainty of services for repairs or maintenance in vicinity in case\nof breakdowns.\n2. Supply Side\n• Dependence on imports for key raw materials\nMany OEMs in India are still dependent on suppliers based out of locations outside India for critical\ncomponents including transmission systems, electronics, semi-conductors, magnets, rare earth materials\netc. to name a few. Metals like lithium, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, etc. are needed for manufacturing EV\nbatteries. Countries deficient in these resources need to depend on imports for manufacturing EVs from\nlimited countries that possess the production capability as well as control the mines for these elements.\nImports increase the cost of procurement of raw materials and hence overall cost of EVs.\nAlso, any unprecedented global event could further elevate the raw material prices along with disrupting\nthe entire supply chain for the same. Currently, India is highly dependent on imports for Lithium-ion\ncells and the dependency on imports along with the lack of robust supply chain network threatens the\ncurrent supply of the batteries. While India recently discovered Lithium reserves in the country,\ncommercialization and setting up the production capabilities of the same will take time, thereby making\nIndia dependent on imports for the medium term.\nWhile many EV suppliers have reached domestic content requirement as mentioned by the government,\nthere are still a lot of component parts that need to be imported. For example, permanent magnets in\nelectric motors, semiconductor chips, electronic child parts, and printed circuit boards (PCBs). Capability\nof Indian OEMs to manufacture and design these complex systems is currently limited owing to limited\ntechnical expertise, less availability of raw materials and intense investment requirement.\nThe government is trying to reduce dependence on these imports by driving several initiatives like Make\nIn India, Atmanirbhar Campaign, PMP, PLI scheme, Custom Duty elimination and enabling FDI across\nsectors, but it may take some time for the OEMs to localize. Until then dependence on imports for certain\ncomponents will continue to carry an inherent risk from supply, pricing and other risks which may\nemanate out of global macro-economic situations.\n• Geo-political and supply chain risks\nIndia is currently dependent on global markets, including China, for the import of battery cells. China\ndominates the global battery supply chain, from mineral processing to cell component manufacturing\nand cell manufacturing. Although China has less control over mineral extraction, mineral processing is\ndominated by China. When it comes to extraction of minerals, there is global concentration of Lithium\n222",

            "page_content": "players differently based on their respective strategies:\n1. Demand Side\n• Slowdown in economic activities impacting buying decision\nIndia’s GDP growth is projected to be 6.8% for fiscal 2025 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% to\n8% between fiscals 2024 and fiscal 2029. Any moderation to GDP growth may have an impact on the\nincomes of people at large and hence the decision to buy two-wheelers\n• Above or below normal monsoons\nWe have considered a normal monsoon scenario while forecasting domestic sales for fiscal 2025 as well\nas forecast till fiscal 2031. If rains are not normal then farm activities and farming output could be\nimpacted which could adversely affect farm related incomes, rural sentiments, food prices and thereby\ninflation. This could directly impact demand for overall two-wheelers\n• Lower Awareness\nOver and above the environmental benefits, EVs offer notable gains over their ICE counterparts.\nHowever, limited awareness and understanding of these benefits restricts the mass scale adoption of EVs.\n• Increase in vehicle cost of acquisition\nThe cost of vehicle acquisition rises when OEMs transfer the impact of increased manufacturing costs to\nthe customers. In the past, the industry has seen price hikes owing to several reasons like increase in raw\nmaterial prices and general inflationary hikes. These are also likely to push vehicle prices upwards going\nforward.\nIt is also expected that going forward battery prices will further decline, and economies of scale will help\nEV OEMs to achieve profitability, thereby the price hikes might be nominal. However, there could be a\nscenario of potential supply chain shocks leading to rise in/ flattish battery prices, or a scenario of lower\neconomies of scale, which might impact overall E2W costs and prices.\nAlso, the cost of acquisition for E2Ws would continue to remain higher than their ICE counterparts over\nthe next few years, which could continue to be a barrier to purchasing.\n• Vehicle Financing and Resale\nVehicle finance rates are also pivotal in determining affordability and cost of ownership for E2W\ncustomers. While financers have started to offer financing products for E2W, the uncertainty about the\nvehicle resale values is still a barrier as it impacts the confidence of financiers who aim for higher tenors.\nDue to relatively lower loan tenors being offered, the effective monthly EMI increases for the customers,\nleading to higher monthly outgo, thereby posing a barrier to purchase.\nGiven that the battery contributes the majority of vehicle cost, there is still an uncertainty about the\nbattery valuation, battery health/life and the overall resale value calculation for E2Ws. The overall EV\nresale ecosystem itself remains one of the biggest unknowns for the segment.\n• Increase in traffic density on account of increasing congestion\nIncreasing traffic congestion on roads especially in urban centers is leading to longer transit times, which\nis also causing a rise in air pollution due to excessive burning of fuel. This problem is leading to more\nand more people preferring to use public modes of transport, and is also driving the growth of public\ntransport systems like metro, e-buses, ride hailing etc. The traffic congestion is expected to rise further\nowing to rapid urbanization, which could lead to customers deferring personal vehicle purchases going\nforward.\n• Charging Infrastructure\n221",

Going\nahead, CRISIL MI&A expects the industry growth to grow at a faster pace of 3-5% CAGR to reach 4.5-5 million\nlevels by fiscal 2031.\nIndia being one of the largest two-wheeler domestic markets globally, has a unique opportunity to leverage its\ndomestic market scale and manufacturing competitiveness to produce electric two-wheelers not just for the\ndomestic market but also for the exports markets. Additionally, the growing demand for eco-friendly and\nsustainable transportation options globally is expected to provide the fillip to e-two-wheelers demand going\nforward. Countries like Nepal, which have a strong dependence on India for their two-wheeler imports, have\ndeclared high electrification targets of 90% EV penetration in all private passenger vehicles sales (including 2W)\nby 2030.

This makes India\nvulnerable to geo-political and supply chain risks. During the pandemic, the world faced semi-conductor\nshortage due to lockdowns in China and disruptions of operations in other supplier countries. Any similar\nglobal incidents, like pandemics, may greatly impact the electric vehicle industry in India in the future.\n• Commodity and input material prices\nThe INR/USD exchange rate also directly impacts the input costs and fuel prices. A weak INR exchange\nrate puts the burden on OEMs for deciding whether or not to pass on the costs to the consumer. Often\nthese fluctuations are absorbed by the OEMs which may negatively impact their overall margins.\nFor example, pricing and availability of commodities like steel and aluminum can be volatile due to\nnumerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions,\ngeopolitical tensions, extreme weather shocks, import duties and tariffs and foreign currency exchange\nrates\n• Availability of skilled manpower\nThe automotive industry is undergoing continuous and rapid technological change in terms of\nintroduction of new powertrains like electric, hybrid and CNG, battery technologies, lightweighting,\nenhanced safety, growth of embedded software technology and driver controls, etc. These continuous\nadvancements have led to a constant demand for skilled manpower in the industry. Currently few OEMs\nare taking initiatives in developing the new age skills inhouse or participating in skill training initiatives\nby associating with various educational institutions and the government.\nHowever, there will still be an ever-growing demand for skilled manpower as the electric vehicle industry\nwill continue to undergo technological advancements in the future and hence availability of manpower\ncould turn out to be a challenge in case of demand supply mismatch.\n• Technology risk\nWith ever changing technology also comes the risk of obsolescence of older technologies. The\nautomotive industry today faces the challenge of adapting newer technologies by either upgrading the\nolder technologies or introducing new ones, thereby posing a risk in terms of capability development,\ninvestments, skill development, technology development and product development as well. For example,\nthe field of battery technology is continuously evolving with current LFP and NMC battery technologies\nbeing challenged by newer technologies like solid state battery, LTO etc. Electric and hybrid\ntechnologies are also continuously evolving. Therefore, going forward, OEMs have to be cautious in\nterms of investing in technology and ensure positive yields.\n• Limited vehicle portfolio\nIn the last 2-3 years, EV offerings of the industry increased multifold with entry of new players,\nexpansion of legacy players into EVs as well as portfolio expansion by current players. Despite this,\ncompared to the ICE portfolio, EV options are still at a nascent stage.\n• Localization norms\nThe government is encouraging localization across sectors, especially in automotive sector via policies\nlike PLI for Automotive Technology, PLI for Advanced Cell Chemistry, Phased Manufacturing Program,\nAtmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India. While the end goal of localization is to reduce import\ndependence, and bring down overall manufacturing costs, it also involves significant initial capital\ninvestments from several stakeholders within the automotive industry. While the government has\ndesigned the schemes to support investments by offering several subsidies and import duty benefits, there\nare still concerns around the meeting the eligibility criteria and availing the benefits. Going forward,\nsimplification and better tracking of the policies will ensure localization in India.\n223",

Our R&D team had 701 on-roll employees, housed at three R&D facilities in Bengaluru, India, as at\nMarch 31, 2024. We had 48% of our total workforce dedicated to R&D as at March 31, 2024. As at August 31,\n2024, globally, we had 291 registered trademarks, 199 registered designs and 45 registered patents, in addition to\npending applications for 11 designs, 93 trademarks and 210 patents.\nWe assemble our E2Ws and manufacture our battery packs at our manufacturing facilities located near Hosur,\nTamil Nadu, India (the “Hosur Factory”). At the Hosur Factory, we had a total annual installed capacity of\n420,000 units for E2Ws and 379,800 units for battery packs as at March 31, 2024. We are in the process of building\nthe first phase of our Factory 3.0 in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (formerly Aurangabad), Maharashtra, India to\nexpand our total installed production capacity to 1.42 million E2Ws upon completion of phase two. We operate\nan asset-light distribution model comprising experience centres and service centres operated by our third-party\nretail partners in India and through an authorised distributor in Nepal. We had 208 experience centres and 191\nservice centres in India, and three experience centres and one service centre in Nepal, as at March 31, 2024. We\nplace an emphasis on capital efficiency across our value chain and prioritise control over design and technology,\nwhile maintaining operational flexibility.\nAs a pure play EV company, our commitment to sustainable business practices is reflected in our environmental,\nsocial and governance (“ESG”) strategy, which focuses on strong governance, developing technologies that\naccelerate the transition to EVs, minimising environmental impact and investing in talent under a focused, single-\ncompany structure. Our corporate ESG committee, along with our code of ethics policy and policies on matters\nsuch as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and fraud prevention, aim to create a culture of responsibility and\nsustainability.\nMarket Opportunity\nUnless otherwise indicated, industry and market data appearing in this section have been derived from the CRISIL\nReport.\nIndia was the largest motorised 2W market by volume in the world in 2023. Total domestic sales in Fiscal Year\n2024 was 18.4 million units. The Indian 2W market is expected to further grow at a CAGR of 7% to 8% between\nFiscal Years 2024 and 2031 to reach a market size of 29 to 31 million in Fiscal Year 2031. Apart from domestic\nsales, Indian 2Ws are also widely exported. Such exports accounted for 15% to 20% of the overall Indian 2W\nsales. Indian OEMs exported 3.5 million 2Ws in Fiscal Year 2024 primarily to Africa, Asia and North America.\nIndia’s middle class is expected to grow to a population of 715 million by Fiscal Year 2031 from 432 million in\nFiscal Year 2021. India’s per capita income is expected to grow at 9.4% CAGR over 2024 to 2029. The growth\nin per capita income and discretionary spending is expected to lead to a corresponding increase in the demand for\npremium products and experiences. There is a clear shift towards preferences for more premium vehicles within\nthe 2W industry. For instance, in the last five years, the share of motorcycles and scooters with an engine capacity\nof 125cc and beyond, increased from approximately 38% and 20% in Fiscal Year 2019, respectively to\napproximately 52% and 47% in Fiscal Year 2024, respectively. Younger buyer profiles, new vehicles with\nattractive features launched at competitive rates, and increasing financing support have supported this\npremiumisation trend within the 2W industry.\nAn expanding E2W portfolio of tech-enabled vehicles at lower acquisition costs has driven consumer interest in\nand accelerated the growth of E2Ws in India. E2Ws currently offer advanced technological features such as touch\nscreen displays, Bluetooth and LTE connectivity. Further, E2Ws also offer a lower total cost of ownership\n(“TCO”) as compared to ICE vehicles. In Fiscal Year 2024, the TCO of an E2W, even without accounting for\nsubsidies, was 37% lower than that of an ICE 2W for an annual running range of 8,000 km. With subsidies\naccounted for in the TCO, this cost saving increased to 55% for Fiscal Year 2024. Assuming that the current GST\nstructure will continue to Fiscal Year 2031, and that some of the subsidies will be provided until Fiscal Year 2026,\nthe acquisition cost (ex-showroom price) between an E2W and ICE 2W is projected to shrink to approximately\n7% by Fiscal Year 2031.\nIn Fiscal Year 2024, E2W penetration rose to 5.1% and EV penetration in the scooter segment increased to around\n15%. Reduction in the acquisition price gap, coupled with the wide range of technological features offered by\nE2Ws are expected to further drive EV penetration. Scooters are expected to lead the electrification of the 2W\nmarket in India, with the penetration of electric scooters expected to reach approximately 70% by Fiscal Year\n2031 and the penetration of electric motorcycles expected to reach approximately 10% by Fiscal Year 2031.

Our Halo smart helmet offers wireless charging, seamless connectivity and a premium sound system,\nwhile maintaining safety standards. We also offer other in-house designed accessories, such as side-steps, body\nguards, seat covers and the Frunk (front storage) for our E2Ws. In addition, the Ather Rizta is equipped with\nadditional accessories designed for convenience, such as a multipurpose charger, storage organiser and back rest.\nOur Charging Infrastructure\nAccording to the CRISIL Report, unavailability and slow development of charging infrastructure are barriers to\nthe adoption of EVs in India. To address this issue, we have designed a comprehensive set of charging solutions\nfor charging at home and on-the-go.\nAccording to the CRISIL Report, we are the first 2W OEM to establish a 2W fast charging network in India in\n2018 and the Ather Grid is India’s widest 2W fast charging network, as at March 31, 2024. Our EV charging\nsolutions comprise (i) the Ather Grid, a public charging network of 1,973 fast chargers and 510 neighbourhood\nchargers spread across 233 cities in India and Nepal, as at March 31, 2024, and (ii) our portable home chargers\nfor home charging, which are bundled and sold with our E2Ws.\nWe designed our own in-house charging connector technology, the Light Electric Combined Charging System\n(“LECCS”) and protocol, for our fast charging network. We worked with various government bodies and the\nBureau of Indian Standards (“BIS”) to establish our LECCS and protocol as an official Indian standard with the\naim of enabling interoperability. In August 2023, BIS published our LECCS as a standard IS17017 (Part2/Sec7)\n: 2023. In February 2024, BIS published the protocol as an official standard IS17017 (Part31) : 2024. As a result,\nany EV owner with an EV that uses the same charging standard, regardless of brand, is able to access our entire\ncharging infrastructure through our Ather Grid app.\nOur Technology and R&D\nOur technology platform is composed of five key elements: (i) battery, (ii) powertrain, (iii) electronics, (iv)\nchassis, and (v) the Atherstack.\nOur battery pack and BMS are developed in-house with a focus on long life, safety and thermal management. Our\ncompact powertrain platform, consisting of our mid-drive motor, in-house developed motor controller (the Ather\nDrive Controller (“ADC”)) and in-house designed transmission system, is designed to offer customers near\ninstantaneous power delivery and consistent performance. Our electronics platform comprises components such\nas the VCU, dashboard, harnesses and fast charging systems. This, along with the Atherstack, has enabled multiple\nconnectivity functions that differentiate the Ather ecosystem. Our chassis platform is modular and caters to both\nperformance and convenience scooter segments. These elements make up the Ather 450 platform.\nThe Ather 450 platform was designed in-house from 2013 to 2018 and we have continued to improve upon the\nplatform since its launch in 2018. The various elements of the platform are common building blocks that we can\nleverage to develop and manufacture different products that cater to a variety of customer preferences. For\ninstance, the Ather Rizta utilises the battery of the Ather 450 platform while using modified chassis and electronics\nplatforms. The Ather Rizta also utilises our Atherstack software. We are developing a new scooter platform and\na motorcycle platform to further address the demand in the E2W market.\nAs at March 31, 2024, we had three R&D facilities in India.

            "page_content": "(Source: CRISIL, Fiscal Year 2024)\nOur Ather 450 line of E2Ws caters to customers seeking a performance scooter. In Fiscal Year 2024, our Ather\n450 line held 11.5% of the market share in the Indian E2W market, according to the CRISIL Report. The\nintroduction of the Ather Rizta marked our entry into the convenience scooter segment, enabling us to address the\nbroader portion of the scooter market. The Ather Rizta is designed for families, featuring a large seat, up to 56 L\nof storage capacity with a joey pocket and safety features such as disc brake, traction control, Emergency Stop\nSignal and Fall Safe. Both models are built on the Ather 450 platform and utilise our proprietary software, the\nAtherstack. We plan to continuously enhance the Ather 450 and Ather Rizta lines by adding new features and\nsoftware updates to meet the growing demand for E2Ws. This will help increase the attractiveness of our E2W\nofferings and therefore increase our sales volume, paving the way to future profitability.\nWe are currently developing two new E2W platforms: a new scooter platform (the EL platform) and a motorcycle\nplatform (the Zenith platform). The EL platform, which is in an advanced stage of development, will serve as a\nmore cost-effective and versatile platform for our scooter lines. It will incorporate a new powertrain, electronics\nand chassis platform, while utilising elements of the battery and Atherstack from the Ather 450 platform. The EL\nplatform will allow us to develop a diverse range of scooter models tailored to various domestic and international\nmarkets needs, and reduce our costs. Additionally, we are developing our Zenith platform, which is designed to\nsupport new E2W models targeting the 125 cc to 300 cc motorcycle segments. According to the CRISIL Report,\nmotorcycles accounted for 63.2% of the Indian 2W market in Fiscal Year 2024. The motorcycle segment presents\na significant opportunity for us to expand our addressable market.\nFurther, we are in the process of designing a new battery platform using the lithium-iron phosphate (“LFP”)\ncathode chemistry to augment our existing battery platform. This new battery platform is expected to be\ncompatible with some of our existing products and leverage the price difference between LFP and nickel based\nchemistries. We are exploring the use of heavy rare earth-free and rare earth magnet-free motors to reduce our\ndependence on the rare earth metals while reducing our costs.

Our technological advancement coupled with competitive cost structures present an opportunity for\nus to leverage the electrification trends in other international markets.\nImproving operational efficiency and manufacturing capabilities through the establishment of our Factory 3.0.\nAccording to the CRISIL Report, E2W demand in India is projected to reach 10.2 million to 12.2 million units by\nFiscal Year 2031. Based on this expected growth rate, we plan to scale up our production capacity to meet the\nprojected demand through the establishment of our Factory 3.0. We plan to commence the first phase of\nconstruction of the Factory 3.0 in March 2025 and plan to commence production at the Factory 3.0 in phases,\nstarting in May 2026.

Upon completion of construction for both phases, our total installed capacity from the\nFactory 3.0 is expected to reach 1 million E2Ws per year.\nCurrently in our Hosur Factory, we focus on assembling E2Ws and manufacturing battery packs. In Factory 3.0,\naside from the available production processes, we plan to introduce backward integrations of certain processes\nsuch as transmission assembly, electronics assembly and painting. These new in-house processes will help de-risk\nour supply chain and mitigate the impact of market fluctuations on our operating costs. We aim to bring in\nflexibility through a focused variant development strategy, which will enable us to retain capacity for new\ntechnology while maintaining our capital efficient approach for investment. In addition, we plan to manufacture\nour new scooter and motorcycle platforms at Factory 3.0, with a similar phased expansion to ensure efficient\ncapital utilisation.\nFurther, by locating Factory 3.0 in a different region, we also seek to mitigate the impact of possible regional\ndisruptions as a result of geographical concentration. With the establishment of our Factory 3.0 at Chhatrapati\nSambhajinagar (formerly Aurangabad), Maharashtra, India, we aim to increase the geographical presence of our\nmanufacturing operations to improve our delivery timeframes and operational efficiencies.

We have focused on\nimproving gross margins through the reduction of the BOM cost of our E2Ws through investments in our R&D\ncapabilities and technologies. We will continue to remain focused on our unit economics, the quality and user\nexperience of our E2Ws, to further our aim of profitability.\nWe have focused on improving gross margins through the reduction in the BOM cost of our E2Ws through\ninvestments in our R&D capabilities and technologies. For example, we have lowered the BOM cost of the Ather\n450X (2.9 kWh) variant by 26% as at March 31, 2024, compared to when it was first produced in Fiscal Year\n2021. Of this 26% reduction in total BOM cost, 16%, 6% and 4% of such reduction were attributable to the\nreductions in the BOM costs of the electronics, mechanicals and battery components, respectively. Meanwhile,\ncompared to the Ather 450X (Gen 3) (3.7 kWh) that was first launched in Fiscal Year 2023, the BOM cost of this\nvariant was reduced by 12% as at March 31, 2024.\nWe have strategically increased the number of key components we design in-house to improve our cost structures.\nFor instance, in Fiscal Year 2022, we introduced the ADC, our in-house motor controller, which generated cost\nsavings of 51% on introduction and improved the feature set of our E2Ws. Our in-house motor controller and in-\nhouse software capabilities enabled us to launch features such as Smart Eco, AutoHold and traction control. We\nalso developed our in-house capabilities to design synchronous belt drive systems, which reduced the cost of our\ntransmission system by 16% on introduction in Fiscal Year 2024.\n241",

For instance, our\nin-house designed ADC reduced our BOM cost for the motor controller by 51% from launch in Fiscal Year 2022\ncompared to the motor controllers sourced from our vendor in Fiscal Year 2021. Our design capabilities also\nenable us to source our components and raw materials from multiple suppliers so as to increase competition, scale\nand supply chain resilience. We outsource the manufacturing of select EV components to a diverse supplier base,\nwhile focusing our resources on the in-house manufacturing of IP sensitive components. We partner with\ninternational technology companies such as Infineon Technologies, Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, Qualcomm Technologies\nInc., LG Energy Solution Ltd., Mahle Electric Drives India Private Limited and Nidec India Private Limited for\ncomponents such as semiconductors, motors and lithium-ion cells. Such partnerships enable us to leverage our\nsuppliers’ scale and capabilities to procure critical raw materials and remain agile with respect to capital intensive\ntechnology. We then manufacture our battery packs and assemble our E2Ws at our manufacturing facilities, on\nassembly lines that we designed in-house.\nOur approach to product design requires strong in-house R&D capabilities across different disciplines, as cross-\ndiscipline advancements in technology enable us to better integrate between various systems and software. This\nintegration in turn allows us to deliver a connected user experience with our ecosystem of products. Our R&D\ncapabilities are reflected in our IP portfolio and our continued efforts to invest in R&D initiatives.\nSoftware-defined ecosystem that drives customer engagement and margins.\nPowered by the in-house developed Atherstack, our software-defined ecosystem aims to improve user experience\nand drive customer engagement. Our continued innovation and improvements to our product ecosystem, driven\nby insights from the Atherstack, generate a flywheel effect. Continuous technological upgrades enhance our\nproducts’ appeal to customers, enabling us to grow our customer base and harness more user data. The insights\nderived from the data collected guide our investments and serve as real-time feedback in our efforts to enhance\nthe Ather ecosystem. The following diagram illustrates our flywheel:\nWe receive data from multiple sources such as the Ather App, our E2Ws, charging infrastructure, smart\naccessories and other information systems. The data from these sources is processed by the Ather Data Platform,\nwhich gives us intelligence on customer cohort usage patterns, product performance, post-sales journey and\ncharging insights. We use this intelligence to design new solutions for our customers across our ecosystem. For\ninstance, based on our customer cohort data, we have created virtual drive cycles that are now part of our test\nstandards, enabling us to more accurately predict the range of our E2Ws and earn the trust of our customers.\nWe also utilise the intelligence gathered on app features to improve engagement. For example, we offer Trip\nPlanner, a data-driven feature that helps customers plan their daily commutes and charge requirements for round-\ntrips. Based on the route they are planning to take, Trip Planner analyses if they are likely to run out of charge\nbased on their past driving style, and will route them to the most suitable Ather Grid public fast charger so that\nthey reach their destination comfortably.\n235",

Further, on August 1, 2024, we signed\na non-binding and non-exclusive memorandum of understanding with Amara Raja Advanced Cell Technologies\nPrivate Limited (“ARACT”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amara Raja Energy & Mobility Ltd., pursuant to\nwhich ARACT will provide samples or prototypes of products involving NMC and/or LFP lithium-ion cells to us\nfor testing and validation. Through this collaboration, we seek to share our own experiences and data-driven\ninsights to facilitate the design, use and manufacture of lithium-ion cells that are customised for our E2Ws and\nmanufacture them in India. Pursuant to the terms of the memorandum of understanding, once the products have\nbeen validated, ARACT will enter into a definitive business arrangement with us before commencing manufacture\nof the developed cells.\nOur approach of partnering with third-party manufacturers for cell manufacturing enables us to take advantage of\nthe declining cost of cells. The prices of lithium-ion cells and battery packs have been declining steadily in recent\nyears according to the CRISIL Report. Moreover, as stated in the CRISIL Report, the average battery pack price\nis expected to further decrease from US$133 per kWh in 2024 to US$113 per kWh in 2025 and US$80 per kWh\nin 2030. According to the CRISIL Report, scale is crucial to make economics work for cell manufacturing.

As a result, establishing our own lithium-ion cell manufacturing\nfacility would not be in line with our capital efficient strategy, given the substantial amount of capital and scale\nrequired.\nThis outsourcing approach also allows for additional flexibility with respect to the incorporation of new\ntechnologies and form factors across product lines.

Our tyre pressure monitoring system is capable of sharing real time tyre pressure updates,\nwhich are displayed on the dashboard and can also send alerts to the rider’s Ather app. We also offer other\naccessories such as throttle grip covers, which provide non-slip grip, scooter covers to protect the scooter from\nexposure to water, dust and heat, and body guards.\nIn April 2024, we introduced our in-house designed smart helmets, the Halo and Halo Bit, to further enhance the\nriding experience. The Halo smart helmet offers features such as ChitChat – a helmet-to-helmet communication\nsystem, a premium sound system, a microphone equipped with noise filtration, in-boot wireless charging with the\nAther Rizta and Auto WearDetect sensors that automatically connects the helmet with the user’s phone when\nworn. The Halo Bit is a device that can be attached to an Ather half-face helmet to provide the user with access\nto some of the Halo smart helmet functions, such as ChitChat, music sharing and ambient noise reduction. Our\nsmart helmets also feature music and call control to improve the rider’s experience. The Halo smart helmet retailed\nfor ₹12,999 and the Halo Bit retailed for ₹4,999, as at June 30, 2024.\nIn Fiscal Years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the total revenue from accessories was ₹193 million, ₹142 million and ₹4\nmillion, respectively\nOur Design and R&D Capabilities\nWe employ a vertically integrated approach to design, which is centred around the user experience. According to\nthe CRISIL report, the key components of an E2W are the charger, battery pack, BMS, motor, motor controller,\ntransmission, chassis, dashboard, DC-DC converter, harnesses and VCU. We designed 80% of these key\ncomponents in-house, as at March 31, 2024. In addition we also develop our entire software stack, Atherstack, in-\nhouse.\nBetween 2013 to 2018, we focused our R&D capabilities on the development of the battery pack, BMS, chassis,\nelectronics, charging infrastructure and the first version of Atherstack for the Ather 450 platform. Since the launch\nof our first product, the Ather 450 in 2018, our R&D efforts have expanded to focus on initiatives such as\nimproving the cost, scalability and features of our E2Ws. This was achieved through projects such as the\ndevelopment of our in-house Ather Drive Controller, an in-house transmission system, a larger battery pack, smart\naccessories and subsequent versions of the Atherstack. These efforts led to the launch of the Ather 450X, Ather\n450S and the Ather 450 Apex. More recently, we focused our R&D efforts on the development of the Ather Rizta\nand the Halo line of smart helmets.\nAs designing key components in-house is crucial to producing quality products at low cost structures and focusing\non user experience, we have built capabilities in areas such as battery technology, power electronics, structural\ndesign, industrial design and software development. Our R&D team is seated across our R&D facilities in\nBangalore, India. These facilities have enabled us to reduce our reliance on third-party suppliers and their\nproximity to our Corporate Office has improved the internal collaborative efficiency. As at March 31, 2024, our\nR&D team comprised 701 on-roll employees. Our R&D facilities serve as the innovation hub where ideas are\ntransformed into tangible products through rigorous testing, experimentation and refinement. Further, these\nfacilities also play a pivotal role in our ability to maintain quality control standards throughout the product\ndevelopment lifecycle to develop reliable and quality E2Ws. The majority of our engineers work from our IBC\nKnowledge Park office, while product testing is conducted in our Proto Lab.\n250",

It also extends to our customers,\nvalue chain partners, financial stakeholders, governments of the countries we operate in, and the communities and\nenvironment in which we operate.\nMitigating the impact of the business of our operations on the environment\nDeveloping technologies\nAccording to the CRISIL Report, LFP is a less mineral intensive chemistry as the need for critical raw materials\nlike lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese is lower. Accordingly, it would help OEMs overcome the supply chain\nchallenges rising from the supply shortage of critical raw materials. Additionally, LFP battery production has a\nlower environmental impact as compared to NMC batteries. We are exploring battery chemistries and motor\ntechnologies that do not contain any rare-earth magnets which will aid our supply chain to be more resilient and\nless carbon intense, while also avoiding the negative externalities associated with mining rare-earth minerals.\nSustainable practices\nAccording to the CRISIL Report, an electric scooter for private use has about 38% lower greenhouse gas (“GHG”)\nemissions than a petrol scooter (~1.8 tCO e). Similarly, transitioning private motorcycles to battery electric\n2\nvehicles can lead to reductions of approximately 1.1 to 1.3 tCO e, representing about 26% less GHG emissions\n2\ncompared to petrol motorcycles. Ather owners have collectively saved ₹6.9 billion in petrol costs and avoided 71\nmillion tonnes of CO emissions from September 2019 to March 2024. In Fiscal Year 2024, we observed an\n2\nimprovement in the utilisation of truck capacity since we began reducing outbound trip requirements for delivery\nof scooters pan India from 36 and 24 lot sizes to 40 lot size.\nOur sustainable manufacturing initiatives include paper-based packaging, renewable energy, air pollution control\nand zero-sewage discharge. The 120 KLD sewage treatment plant installed in our Hosur Factory ensures zero-\nsewage discharge from our manufacturing operations and the wastewater from the sewage treatment plant is\nutilised for gardening.\nWe have adopted green packaging and reusable packaging such as water-based paper tapes, paper pouches, paper\nbubble wraps, shredded carton waste used as cushion/ fillers, Velcro straps, biodegradable packaging sheets, and\nrecycled paper. We have adopted reusable containers/returnable containers like reusable pallet, reusable trays,\nfoldable containers, reusable trolleys, to reduce consumption of fresh packaging materials and waste management\ncost. Supplier packaging waste has been reduced by 2.3 kg/vehicle from Fiscal Year 2022 to Fiscal Year 2024.\nWith a current system size of 200 kWh, 13% of our current manufacturing capacity energy needs, on average,\nwere powered by solar panels installed on-site in our Hosur Factory in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThe implementation of ISO 14001 of environmental management system has led to optimisation of energy\nconsumption through various energy-saving projects in Fiscal Years 2023 and 2024, such as optimisation of\ncompressed air generation by reduction of working pressure from 6.7 to 5.5 Bar and provision of 10 cfm 2.2 kW\nnew screw compressor instead of 37 kW 250 cfm compressor for the continuous operation of IQC lab.\nIn addition, we have installed the Retrofit Emission Control Device for all DG sets. This has allowed us to reduce\nair emission particles in the exhaust by 80%.\nThe installation of a regenerative dynamometer has helped to put electricity consumed in vehicle testing back to\nthe internal grid.\nWe are compliant with legal requirements under the Environment Protection Act 1986, hazardous waste and other\nwaste rules 2016, and battery waste management rules 2022. We have tie-ups with third-party vendors such as\nLohum Cleantech Private Limited for battery end-of-life recycling.\nInvesting in talent and community development\nOur talent\nTAAS is our culture collective that serves as a building block for our thoughts, actions, and working ways.

The first phase of construction is expected to be completed by March 2027,\nfollowing which, it will provide an additional installed production capacity of 0.5 million E2Ws per year. Upon\ncompletion of construction for both phases, our total installed capacity from the Hosur Factory and Factory 3.0 is\nexpected to reach a total of 1.42 million E2Ws per year.\nAt the Factory 3.0, we plan to integrate additional automation technologies and manufacturing lines for selected\nmanufacturing processes that we currently outsource to third-party OEM manufacturers, in order to achieve\ngreater cost efficiencies in our production process and enhance our control over the integrity and quality of our\nproducts. These processes have been selected to help with mitigation of supply chain risks, flexibility to address\nmarket demands and ensure better control over product quality. We have identified certain manufacturing\nprocesses that we currently outsource to third-party manufacturers, which we intend to execute in-house. This\napproach will provide us with greater agility in responding to changes in customer demand and greater resilience\nto supply disruptions.\nOur Supply Chain\nWhile we design key components of our EVs and some of our accessories in-house, we strategically focus on\nmanufacturing IP-sensitive components in-house and outsource the manufacturing of other components to\nrenowned vendors. We have direct arrangements with large OEMs to procure components such as lithium-ion\ncells and semiconductors, which require a high upfront capital investment, to optimise our own capital\nexpenditures and maintain flexibility in the face of the fast-evolving technology landscape. We similarly outsource\nthe manufacture of our in-house designed chassis, BMS, VCU, motor controller, signal harness and fast charger,\nto third-party manufacturers or vendors. Our direct arrangements with our suppliers enable us to bypass\nintermediaries and partner with suppliers who meet our quality criteria to procure supplies.\nWe maintain a localised and diversified supplier base which enhances our supply chain resilience. As at March\n31, 2024, March 31, 2023, and March 31, 2022, we had 230 suppliers, 160 suppliers and 123 suppliers,\nrespectively. Aside from lithium-ion cells, semi-conductor chips and belts, all our key components were locally\nsourced. We strive to maintain relationships with multiple suppliers for a single component, and multi-source\ncomponents comprised 63%, 65% and 28% of the BOM value of our Ather 450X 2.9 kWh in Fiscal Years 2024,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. 99% of our E2W components by BOM value, other than lithium-ion cells, are\nsourced domestically. The largely localised nature of our supply enables us to procure supplies at lower costs\ngiven the reduction of transportation costs. The proximity to our suppliers also reduces lead times, facilitates just-\nin time inventory management and minimises our inventory costs.\nWe evaluate and select our suppliers with a view to maintaining the consistent quality of our products, optimising\nour cost structure and managing potential supply chain risks. We have developed internal processes for risk\nassessment, which measure the performance of our suppliers across multiple parameters and ensure we mitigate\nrisks in our supply chain. We place an emphasis on the digitisation of our supply chain to enable robust governance.\nAs part of our internal Environmental, Health, Safety and Social (“EHSS”) Policy, we place a strong emphasis\non engaging suppliers and contractors who demonstrate a commitment towards ESG principles. We have\ncommenced a process for measuring our suppliers’ emission to better understand our overall environmental\nfootprint. See “―Environmental, Social and Governance” on page 271.\nOur Distribution and Service Network\nOur distribution and servicing network comprises experience centres and service centres spread across India and\nin Nepal, which are primarily operated by our retail partners in India and through our authorised distributor in\nNepal. This distribution model enables us to leverage the expertise of third-party dealers and service providers to\nfurther enhance the user experience.\nWe opened our first experience centre outside of India, in Kathmandu, Nepal, in November 2023. Nepal's strong\ndependence on India for their 2W imports and its high electrification target of 90% EV penetration in all private\npassenger vehicle sales (including 2Ws) by 2030, according to the CRISIL Report, drove our decision to enter\ninto the Nepalese market. In August 2024, we announced plans to enter into Sri Lanka.\n266",

NOTES TO RESTATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe Company is a party to certain tax and other disputes with government authorities. Due to the\nuncertainty associated with such cases, it is possible that, on conclusion of such matters at a future\ndate, the final outcome may differ significantly.\nd. Useful lives of depreciable assets\nManagement reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date. As at 31 March\n2024, 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, management assessed that the useful lives represent the\nexpected utility of the assets to the Company. Further, there is no significant change in the useful\nlives as compared to previous years.\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2023, based on a detailed reassessment carried out by the technical\nteam for amortisation of internally generated intangible assets, the Company has decided to use,\nthe ‘useful life’ method for amortising such intangible assets as against the “unit of production”\nmethod. Useful life method better represents the usage pattern of the assets over their useful lives.\nAccordingly, internally generated intangible assets have been amortised on straight-line basis over\ntheir useful lives.\ne. Provision for warranty\nProvisions for warranty-related costs are recognized when the products are sold by the Company.\nProvision is estimated based on historical experience and/or technical estimates. Provisions are\ndiscounted, where necessary, to its present value based on the best estimate required to settle the\nobligation at each reporting date. These are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect\nthe current best estimates.\nf. Share based payment\nEmployees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of Share-based Payment transactions,\nwhereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled\ntransactions). In accordance with the Ind AS 102 Share-based Payment, the cost of equity-settled\ntransactions is measured using the fair value method. The cumulative expense recognised for\nequity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which\nthe vesting year has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments\nthat will ultimately vest. The expense or credit recognised in the restated statement of profit and\nloss for a year represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and\nend of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.\ng. Inventories\nThe Company estimates the net realisable value (NRV) of its inventories by taking into account\ntheir estimated selling price, estimated cost of completion, estimated costs necessary to make the\nsale. Management periodically reviews the inventory listing to determine if any allowance should\nbe accounted for in the restated financial information for obsolete or slow-moving items, and to\ncompare the carrying value of inventory items with their respective net realizable value.\n1.3.4 Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses,\nif any. Cost includes purchase price, related taxes, duties, freight, insurance, etc. attributable to the\nacquisition, installation of the PPE and borrowing cost if capitalisation criteria are met but excludes\nduties and taxes that are recoverable from tax authorities.\n333",

NOTES TO RESTATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nUseful lives of other intangible assets :\nOther intangible assets are amortised over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a\nstraight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an\nidentifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence,\ndemand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known\ntechnological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected\nfuture cash flows from the asset.\nThe management estimates the useful lives for its assets as follows:\nUseful life and Basis of\nDescription of Assets amortisation based on the\nManagement estimates\na) Software 5 years\nb) Patent& other intellectual property rights 5 years\nc) Website 3 years\nd) Product development (internally generated intangible 2 - 7 years\nassets)\n1.3.6 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets\nThe Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be\nimpaired. If any indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s\nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) net selling price and its\nvalue in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not\ngenerate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where\nthe carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered\nimpaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\nand intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever\nthere is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a\npre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks\nspecific to the asset. In determining net selling price, recent market transactions are taken into account,\nif available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\nThe Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are\nprepared separately for each of the Company’s cash-generating units to which the individual assets are\nallocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. For\nlonger periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the\nfifth year.\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously\nrecognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the\nCompany estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognized\nimpairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the\nasset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so\nthat the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying\namount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized\nfor the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the restated statement of profit and loss unless\nthe asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.\n336\n\n[TABLES]\nDescription of Assets | Useful life and Basis of\namortisation based on the\nManagement estimates\na) Software | 5 years\nb) Patent& other intellectual property rights | 5 years\nc) Website | 3 years\nd) Product development (internally generated intangible\nassets) | 2 - 7 years",

Information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in\napplying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the\nRestated Financial Information is included in the following notes:\na. Intangible assets and intangible assets under development\nCapitalisation of cost in intangible assets and intangible assets under development is based on\nmanagement’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed and asset under\ndevelopment will generate economic benefits in future. Based on the impairment assessment\ncarried out, the Company’s management has determined that these assets have not suffered any\nimpairment loss.\nb. Defined benefit plans\nThe cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-employment benefits and the present value of\nsuch obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making\nvarious assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the\ndetermination of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension\nincreases. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined\nbenefit obligation is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at\neach reporting date.\nc. Provisions and contingent liability\nOn an ongoing basis, Company reviews pending cases, claims by third parties and other\ncontingencies. For contingent losses that are considered probable, an estimated loss is recorded as\nan accrual in the Restated Financial Information. Contingent loss that are considered possible are\nnot provided for but disclosed as Contingent liabilities in the Restated Financial Information.\nContingencies the likelihood of which is remote are not disclosed in the Restated Financial\nInformation. Contingent gains are not recognized until the contingency has been resolved and\namounts are received or receivable.\n332",

Impairment of financial assets\nIn accordance with Ind-AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for\nmeasurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit\nrisk exposure:\n• Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans,\ndebt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance\nThe Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance\non Trade receivables.\nThe application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in\ncredit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each\nreporting date, right from its initial recognition.\nLifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over\nthe expected life of a financial instrument. ECL is the difference between all contractual cash\nflows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that\nthe entity expects to receive, discounted at the original EIR. When estimating the cash flows,\nan entity is required to consider:\n• All contractual terms of the financial instrument (including prepayment, extension, call\nand similar options) over the expected life of the financial instrument. However, in rare\ncases when the expected life of the financial instrument cannot be estimated reliably,\nthen the entity is required to use the remaining contractual term of the financial\ninstrument\n• Cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral\nto the contractual terms\nECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as\nincome/ expense in the restated statement of profit and loss. This amount is reflected under\nthe head ‘other expenses’ in the restated statement of profit and loss.

The liabilities are presented as current employee benefit obligations in the\nrestated statement of assets and liabilities. Short term employee benefits include short term\ncompensated absences which is recognized based on the eligible leave at credit on the\nreporting date, and the estimated cost is based on the terms of the employment contract.\n1.3.11 Leases\nThe Company assesses, whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease\nif the contract involves– (a) the use of an identified asset, (b) the right to obtain substantially all the\neconomic benefits from use of the identified asset, and (c) the right to direct the use of the identified\nasset.\nAs a lessee : The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease\ncommencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the\ninitial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the\ncommencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle\nand remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located,\nless any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement\ndate on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying\nasset.\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment\ntesting, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-\nuse) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that\nare largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is\ndetermined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments at the\ncommencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot\nbe readily determined, company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the company uses its\nincremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a\ncorresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment\nif whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\nA lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in\nwhich case the lease liability is remeasured based on the lease term of the modified lease by\ndiscounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the\nmodification.\nAs a practical expedient, Ind AS 116 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and\ninstead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The\nCompany has used this practical expedient.\n340",

Subsequent measurement\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives, financial liabilities\nheld for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value\nthrough profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred\nfor the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial\ninstruments entered by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge\nrelationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as\nheld for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.\nRight to subscribe\nThe Shareholder Agreement includes an Anti-Dilution Price Protection clause ie. in the event\nof a down round funding, existing shareholders will have the right to purchase a certain number\nof additional shares at nominal value to compensate them. This down-round protection has been\nseparated from the host preference shares and has been recognized as a derivative liability per\nInd AS 32, Presentation of financial instruments. This financial liability is measured at FVTPL\nin the financial statements per Ind AS 109, Financial Instrument.\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the restated statement of profit\nor loss.\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are\ndesignated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are\nsatisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in\nown credit risks are recognized in other comprehensive income. These gains/ losses are not\nsubsequently transferred to restated statement of profit and loss. However, the Company may\ntransfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability\nare recognised in the restated statement of profit and loss.\nLoans and borrowings\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at\namortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the\nliabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and\nfees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance\ncosts in the restated statement of profit and loss.\nDe-recognition\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or\ncancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same\nlender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially\nmodified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original\nliability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts\nis recognised in the restated statement of profit and loss.\nOffsetting of financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the restated\nstatement of assets and liabilities if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the\n347",

NOTES TO RESTATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nbest estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in\nthe restated statement of profit and loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense\nrecognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.\nService and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant\ndate fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the\nCompany’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market\nperformance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to\nan award, but without an associated service requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions.\nNon-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing\nof an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions.\nNo expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance\nand/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition,\nthe transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is\nsatisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\n1.3.18 Financial Instruments\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial\nliability or equity instrument of another entity.\nA. Financial assets\ni. Initial recognition and measurement\nAll financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets\nnot recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the\nacquisition of the financial asset.\nTrade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the\nCompany has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price\ndetermined under Ind AS 115. Refer accounting policy on ‘Revenue from contracts with\ncustomers’.\nii. Subsequent measurement\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:\na. Financial assets at amortised cost\nb. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI)\nc. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nd. Equity instruments measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income\na. Financial assets at amortised cost\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at the amortised cost if both the following\nconditions are met:\n• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting\ncontractual cash flows, and\n• Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely\npayments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost\nusing the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into\naccount any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of\nthe EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses\n344",

The decrease was mainly due to the reduction in the FAME subsidies. The subsidies were\nreduced from ₹15,000 per kWh to ₹10,000 per kWh, with effect from June 1, 2023. As a result of the reduced\nFAME subsidy, our customers faced an increase in the retail price of our E2Ws ranging from ₹20,434 to ₹30,285.\nHowever, in response to the reduction in the FAME subsidy, we launched new variants with lower battery capacity\nat lower prices, namely, the Ather 450X (2.9 kWh) and Ather 450S, to attract customers. Further in August 2023\nand January 2024, we launched our higher battery capacity variants, the Ather 450X (3.7 kWh) and the Ather 450\nApex, respectively. The Ather 450 Apex is our most premium E2W model.\nThese new launches enabled us to increase sales volume of E2Ws to 109,557 E2Ws sold in Fiscal Year 2024\n(comprising 22,712 units of the Ather 450S, 39,067 units of the Ather 450X, 11,249 units of Ather 450X (2.9\nkWh), 35,999 units of Ather 450X (3.7 kWh) and 550 units of the Ather 450 Apex) as compared to 92,093 E2Ws\nsold in Fiscal Year 2023 (comprising 92,093 units of the Ather 450X), with the new Ather 450S contributing\nsignificantly to sales. Nonetheless, given the lower price of the Ather 450S and the 6% decrease in the sales of\nour flagship Ather 450X model, our revenue from sale of E2Ws declined.\n406\n\n[TABLES]\n|  | Fiscal Year |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  | 2024 |  |  |  |  | 2023 |  | 2022 |  | \nParticulars |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  | Amount |  |  | % of Total |  | Amount | % of Total | Amount | % of Total | \n |  | (in ₹ million) |  |  | income |  | (in ₹ million) | income | (in ₹ million) | income |",

This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of certain factors, such as the risks set forth in the chapters entitled “Risk Factors” and “Forward-\nLooking Statements” on pages 36 and 20, respectively.\nIndustry and market data used in this section have been extracted from the CRISIL Report and such excerpts may\nhave been re-ordered by us for the purpose of presentation. The CRISIL Report has been commissioned by our\nCompany exclusively in connection with the Offer for the purposes of confirming our understanding of the industry\nin which we operate.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a pioneer in the Indian electric two-wheeler (“E2W”) market, according to the CRISIL Report. We design\nand develop E2Ws, battery packs, charging infrastructure, associated software and accessories, manufacture\nbattery packs and assemble our E2Ws in-house. We are a pure play EV company that designs all our products\nground-up in India. We sold 109,577 E2Ws in Fiscal Year 2024. According to the CRISIL Report, in Fiscal Year\n2024, we were the third largest player by volume of E2W sales.\nWe build products with a focus on quality and user experience. Our products are positioned at premium prices in\ntheir respective segments. We launched our first product, the Ather 450, in June 2018 and have launched our first\nconvenience scooter, the Ather Rizta series, in April 2024. Our current E2W portfolio comprises two product lines\n– the Ather 450 line, which caters to customers seeking performance scooters, and the Ather Rizta line, which is\ntargeted at customers seeking convenience scooters for their family. Our E2Ws are complemented by our product\necosystem which comprises charging infrastructure, accessories and the Atherstack, our in-house developed\nsoftware that powers our products.\nWe operate an asset-light distribution model comprising experience centres and service centres operated by our\nthird-party retail partners in India and through our authorised distributor in Nepal. We had 208 experience centres\nand 191 service centres in India, and three experience centres and one service centre in Nepal, as at March 31,\n2024. Our experience centres are designed to provide a curated and comfortable experience for potential\ncustomers. As at March 31, 2024, we had a service centre to experience centre ratio of 0.9 in India, which ensured\nthe availability of after-sales service to our customers. We also introduced our fast charging network, the Ather\nGrid, in every city to which we expanded our distribution network through our retail partner-operated experience\ncentres. According to the CRISIL Report, we were the first 2W OEM to establish a 2W fast charging network in\nIndia and the Ather Grid is India’s widest 2W fast charging network, as at March 31, 2024.\nWe assemble our E2Ws and manufacture our battery packs at the Hosur Factory, our manufacturing facilities\nlocated near Hosur, Tamil Nadu, India. Our Hosur Factory had a total annual installed capacity of 420,000 units\nfor E2Ws and 379,800 units for battery packs as at March 31, 2024. We are in the process of building our Factory\n3.0 in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (formerly Aurangabad), Maharashtra, India and expect to expand our total\nproduction capacity to 1.42 million E2Ws following the final phase of construction.\nFor more details on our business, see “Our Business” on page 225.\n396",

The introduction of new portfolio offerings, such as the launch of the Halo\nsmart helmets, the Atherstack 6.0 and our latest E2W model, the Ather Rizta, in April 2024, enable us to expand\ninto different customer segments to attract new customers and grow our customer base.\nTo further enhance customer satisfaction, we strive to maintain a ratio of service centres to experience centres\nabove one in all cities in which we operate. The total number of our experience centres and service centres located\nin India and Nepal increased from 34 experience centres and 30 service centres as at March 31, 2022 to 117\nexperience centres and 102 service centres as at March 31, 2023 and 211 experience centres and 192 service\ncentres as at March 31, 2024. Our service centre to experience centre ratio as at March 31, 2024 was 0.9 in India\nand 0.3 in Nepal. We offer training to the sales and service personnel at our retail partners’ experience centres and\nservice centres to ensure a consistent and high quality customer experience. In addition, we expanded the Ather\nGrid from 291 chargers as at March 31, 2022 to 1,175 chargers as at March 31, 2023 and 2,483 chargers as at\nMarch 31, 2024. Our existing pool of customer data allows us to enhance our products through user insights, and\nfurther expand our customer base. We invest in brand building initiatives, such as online marketing campaigns\nand sports marketing campaigns, to spread brand visibility and drive long-term customer loyalty.\nCustomer recognition of our commitment to quality and customer experience is reflected in the expansion of our\ncustomer base from 23,062 customers in Fiscal Year 2022 to 84,505 customers in Fiscal Year 2023 and 113,992\ncustomers in Fiscal Year 2024, as well as the corresponding growth in vehicle sales from 23,402 units in Fiscal\nYear 2022 to 92,093 units in Fiscal Year 2023 and 109,577 units in Fiscal Year 2024.\nWe will continue investing in the expansion of our product portfolio by launching E2Ws that cater to the broader\n2W market, while also continuing to enhance the Ather 450 and Ather Rizta lines by adding new features and\nsoftware updates to meet the growing demand for E2Ws and attract new customers. According to the CRISIL\nReport, demand for E2Ws is expected to continue to grow at a CAGR of 41% to 44% to reach a market size of\n10.2 million to 12.2 million units by Fiscal Year 2031, and we seek to continue to grow our portfolio offerings to\ncapture this growth. We also plan to further expand and deepen our distribution network in India, leveraging on\nour asset-light distribution model. As we expand our distribution network, we will also expand our charging\ninfrastructure in every region that we enter. We will also seek opportunities to expand into other international\nmarkets where we identify significant untapped demand for our products. Our ability to attain commercial\nacceptance for our products in new markets will be a key factor in accelerating revenue growth.\nInvestments in our in-house R&D, design and manufacturing capabilities\nOur future profitability significantly depends on our ability to innovate and manufacture our E2Ws in an efficient\nmanner. We have made significant investments into R&D, focused on the development of EV-related technologies\nand new scooter and battery platforms in order to expand our product line, lower our BOM and manufacturing\ncosts and improve our operational efficiencies.\nOur R&D expenditure amounted to ₹2,365 million, ₹1,916 million and ₹1,010 million in Fiscal Years 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. In Fiscal Year 2024, we made 91 engineering changes which helped reduce our bill of\nmaterials (“BOM”) costs. Further, our vertically integrated approach to technology and design of the majority of\nour key components have allowed us to better manage our costs. For example, we redesigned our ADC, which\nreduced our BOM cost for the motor controller by 51% from launch in Fiscal Year 2022 as compared to the motor\ncontrollers sourced from our vendor in Fiscal Year 2021. Our efforts have enabled us to achieve an Adjusted\nGross Margin of 9% in Fiscal Year 2024, 11% in Fiscal Year 2023 and 7% in Fiscal Year 2022. Through our\ncontinued investments in our R&D, E2Ws and testing capabilities, we improved the quality of our products and\nreduced our warranty costs as a percentage of our total income to 2% in Fiscal Year 2024, from 3% in Fiscal Year\n2023 and 5% in Fiscal Year 2022.\nWe plan to continue investing significantly in our R&D, design and manufacturing capabilities to further enhance\nour product ecosystem, generate greater economies of scale and cost reductions, lower supply chain dependencies\nand enhance the user experience. For example, we are developing a new E2W platform (the EL platform) and a\nnew battery platform in order to improve the cost structures of our E2Ws. We have also commissioned a new\nR&D facility, the Product Validation Lab, in the Begur area of Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, to further enhance\nour R&D capabilities. In order to further expand our production capacity, we plan to build the Factory 3.0 in\nChhatrapati Sambhajinagar (formerly Aurangabad), Maharashtra, India, and integrate automation technologies\nand select manufacturing processes for certain components that we currently outsource to achieve greater cost\nefficiencies. These processes include electronics assembly, transmission assembly, and painting. Upon the\n400",

For\nadditional details on our future R&D investments, please see “Objects of the Offer - Outlook towards future\nR&D investments” on page 159.\nOur ability to develop and manage a resilient supply chain\nAccording to the CRISIL Report, supply chain resilience is one of the key factors for success in EVs. Our ability\nto maintain a localised and diversified supplier base while being strategic in the selection of components to\nmanufacture in-house is a key driver for future profitability. We have built a diversified and localised supplier\nbase, which comprised 230 suppliers as at March 31, 2024. Except for lithium-ion cells, we sourced 99% of our\nE2W components by BOM value as at March 31, 2024, domestically. The largely localised nature of our supply\nenables us to procure supplies at lower costs given the reduction of transportation costs. The proximity to our\nsuppliers also reduces lead times, facilitates just-in time inventory management and minimises our inventory costs.\nTo further develop and manage our supply chain resilience, we plan to enter into long-term supply arrangements\nwith our lithium-ion cell suppliers to ensure a stable and consistent supply of lithium-ion cells on favourable\nterms. We seek to collaborate with a domestic lithium-ion cell manufacturer to drive the manufacturing process\nin India. Our ability to successfully execute on these initiatives will enable us to further strengthen the resilience\nof our supply chain.\nImprovement of costs and profitability\nThrough our R&D capabilities, scalable technology platform, premium positioning across segments and capital\nefficient business model, we have reduced our costs and improved our revenue, as evidenced by the growth of our\nrevenue which has outpaced the increase in our total expenses.\nOur revenue from operations grew by 329% from Fiscal Year 2022 to Fiscal Year 2024. We recorded an increase\nto ₹15,819 million of revenue from sale of finished goods in Fiscal Year 2024 from ₹14,327 million in Fiscal\nYear 2023 and ₹3,703 million in Fiscal Year 2022. The increase in our revenue from sale of finished goods,\ncoupled with the increase in EBITDA Margin to (36%) in Fiscal Year 2024 from (38%) in Fiscal Year 2023 and\n(62%) in Fiscal Year 2022, did not result in a commensurate increase in our total expenses. Our total expenses\n(excluding exceptional items) as a percentage of total income increased marginally to 149% in Fiscal Year 2024,\nfrom 148% in Fiscal Year 2023 and decreased from 183% in Fiscal Year 2022. Please see “ - Non-GAAP\nMeasures – Reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA Margin” on page 412.\nOur focus on premium positioning across segments and cost reduction has improved our unit economics. This, in\nturn, has reduced our dependence on government subsidies under the FAME scheme and improved our margins\nto further our aim of achieving profitability. Our revenue from government subsidies under the FAME scheme as\na percentage of our revenue from operations reduced to 16% in Fiscal Year 2024 from 24% in Fiscal Year 2022,\nand we expect this figure to be further reduced in the future. The premium positioning of our E2Ws across\nsegments has ensured that the variation of our revenue per E2W, exclusive of subsidies, was less than 5% in the\npast three Fiscal Years. Further, our Adjusted Gross Margin also increased from 7% in Fiscal Year 2022 to 9% in\nFiscal Year 2024, despite the 41% decrease in subsidies in Fiscal Year 2024 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022.\nOur Adjusted Gross Margins Excluding Subsidies under the FAME scheme improved by 11% in the past three\nFiscal Years, to (6%) in Fiscal Year 2024 from (17%) in Fiscal Year 2022.

            "page_content": "Government incentive packages\nWe have benefited from various government incentives seeking to encourage EV adoption. Such subsidies lower\nthe price point of our products to consumers and help to spur customer demand for our E2Ws. Our E2Ws qualified\nfor the Government of India’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric (“FAME”) subsidy until its expiry\non March 31, 2024, following which, all our E2Ws except for the Ather 450 Apex qualified for the Electric\nMobility Promotion Scheme 2024 (“EMPS 2024”), which succeeded the FAME subsidy. Accordingly, under the\nEMPS scheme, such vehicles are eligible for a subsidy of ₹10,000 per vehicle as at July 31, 2024. The EMPS\n2024 has been extended to September 30, 2024. Further, in certain states, our Company and our customers also\nqualify for certain tax exemptions in relation to road tax. These incentives further drive the demand for EVs in\nIndia.\nOur ability to qualify for or maintain eligibility for such government incentives is a key factor that affects our\nability to maintain and grow our market share. We may experience recalls or scale backs on benefits available to\nEV manufacturers under various government incentive schemes. For example, pursuant to a notification dated\nMay 19, 2023 from the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India, the cap on incentives for the FAME\nscheme was scaled back from ₹15,000 per kWh to ₹10,000 per kWh, with effect from June 1, 2023. As a result\nof the reduced subsidy, our customers faced an increase in the retail price of our E2Ws ranging from ₹20,434 to\n₹30,285. The EMPS 2024 scheme was due to expire on July 31, 2024 but pursuant to a notification by the Ministry\nof Heavy Industries, Government of India, it was extended to September 30, 2024. There is no assurance that the\nEMPS 2024 scheme will be extended or replaced by a similar subsidy scheme. In Fiscal Years 2024, 2023 and\n2022, revenue from government subsidies under the FAME scheme comprised 16%, 28% and 24% of our revenue\nfrom operations, respectively. We seek to reduce our costs, improve our operational efficiencies and maintain our\npremium position across segments to further reduce our reliance on government incentives. Revenue from\ngovernment incentives constituted only 16% of our revenue from operations in Fiscal Year 2024.\nGrowth of India’s economy and growing aspiration of Indian consumers to acquire premium E2Ws\nOur two E2W models, the Ather 450 and the Ather Rizta, are positioned as premium offerings in their respective\nmarket segments and are therefore susceptible to India’s macroeconomic developments that could affect\ndiscretionary consumer spending, particularly for premium goods.\nAccording to the CRISIL Report, India’s GDP grew at a CAGR of 4.3% between Fiscal Years 2019 and 2024\nwith per capita income expected to increase to about US$4,500 by Fiscal Year 2031. Further, according to the\nCRISIL Report, India’s per capita disposable income is expected to grow by 8% in Fiscal Year 2024 and 13.3%\nin Fiscal Year 2023. In line with these growths, the share of premium vehicles increased from ~38% in Fiscal\nYear 2019 to ~52% in Fiscal Year 2024 for motorcycles and from ~20% in Fiscal Year 2019 to ~47% in Fiscal\nYear 2024 for scooters, according to the CRISIL Report. According to the CRISIL Report, EV penetration is\nexpected to reach approximately 35% of industry sales by Fiscal Year 2031. Our ability to continue to grow our\nbusiness depends on the growth of India’s economy and the trend for demand for premium products.\nLeveraging on our product usage insights, we seek to continue designing and manufacturing E2Ws and EV-related\naccessories that meet the growing aspirations of our target customers across all 2W segments.

See under “Restated Financial\nInformation Notes forming part of the Restated Financial Information – Note 1.3: Summary of Material\nAccounting Policies” on page 330. The critical accounting policies that our management believes to be the most\nsignificant are summarised below.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment (“PPE”) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if\nany. Cost includes purchase price, related taxes, duties, freight, insurance, etc. attributable to the acquisition,\ninstallation of the PPE and borrowing cost if capitalisation criteria are met but excludes duties and taxes that are\nrecoverable from tax authorities.\nMachinery spares which can be used only in connection with an item of PPE and whose use is expected to be\nirregular are capitalised and depreciated over the useful life of the principal item of the relevant assets. Subsequent\nexpenditure relating to PPE is capitalised only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the\nitem will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\nMaterial replacement cost is capitalised provided it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the\nitem will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. When replacement cost is eligible\nfor capitalisation, the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced are derecognised. When significant parts of\nplant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, we depreciate them separately based on their specific\nuseful life.\nPPE retired from active use and held for sale are stated at the lower of their net book value and net realisable value\nand are disclosed separately in the restated statement of assets and liabilities.\nWe identify and determine the cost of each component / part of the asset separately if the component / part has a\ncost that is significant to the total cost of the asset and has useful life that is materially different from that of the\nremaining asset.\nPPE not ready for the intended use, on the reporting date, are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress” and are\ncarried at cost, comprising direct cost and attributable interest.\nDepreciation and amortisation\nDepreciation is provided on a pro rata basis using the straight line method to allocate the cost, net of residual value\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nDepreciation has been provided on the straight-line method based on the useful life as prescribed in Schedule II\nto the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the following categories of assets:\nDescription of Assets Useful life and Basis of Depreciation\nPlant and Machinery – Laboratory Equipment 5 years\nPlant and Machinery – Moulds and Jigs 8 years\nLeasehold Improvements Over the primary lease period or the\nlife of the asset whichever is lower.\nInternally built vehicles 3 years\nElectric installation Over the primary lease period or 10\nyears whichever is lower\nCharging Infrastructure 3 years\nBased on technical assessment made by technical expert and management estimate, we depreciate above items of\nPPE over estimated useful lives which are different from the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies\nAct, 2013. The Management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation\nof the period over which the assets are likely to be used.\nThe estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting\nperiod, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.\nFinance lease assets are depreciated over the primary lease period as the right to use of these assets ceases on\nexpiry of the lease period.\n422\n\n[TABLES]\n| Description of Assets |  |  | Useful life and Basis of Depreciation |",

This increase is mainly attributable to the\nincrease in the sales volume of our E2Ws and the change in our policies whereby we ceased selling our standard\nportable chargers separately from our E2Ws as sale of stock-in-trade and priced the chargers into the retail price\nof the E2Ws from April 13, 2023 onwards.\nOur sale of services decreased to ₹1,190 million in Fiscal Year 2024 from ₹1,397 million in Fiscal Year 2023 due\nto the introduction of a lower priced Pro Pack bundle for our low battery capacity variants.\nOther income\nOur other income increased to ₹353 million in Fiscal Year 2024 from ₹209 million in Fiscal Year 2023, mainly\ndue to an increase in the interest income on term deposits to ₹164 million in Fiscal Year 2024 from ₹75 million\nin Fiscal Year 2023 as a result of an increase in the interest rate on our term deposits and an increased average\nholding of funds in our term deposits.\nExpenses\nOur total expenses increased to ₹26,742 million in Fiscal Year 2024 from ₹26,663 million in Fiscal Year 2023,\nprimarily due to an increase in cost of materials consumed in the production of our E2Ws, changes in inventories\nof finished goods, stock-in-trade and work-in-progress, employee benefits expense, finance costs and depreciation\nand amortisation expenses, in line with the growth in sales of our E2Ws. Our total expenses as a percentage of\ntotal income were 149% in Fiscal Year 2024 as compared to 148% in Fiscal Year 2023.\nCost of materials consumed\nOur cost of materials consumed increased to ₹15,792 million in Fiscal Year 2024 from ₹15,370 million in Fiscal\nYear 2023, primarily due to an increase in the production of E2Ws to meet the higher sales volume of our E2Ws\nand the shift in the recognition of the cost of chargers, whose prices were included within the price of E2Ws from\nApril 13, 2023 onwards. The increase was partially offset by cost efficiencies generated through our in-house\ndesign and R&D initiatives, which lowered our average BOM cost per vehicle. Moreover, the launch of new E2W\nvariants with lower battery capacity also decreased our overall volume of lithium-ion cells consumed in Fiscal\nYear 2024 as compared to that in Fiscal Year 2023, partially offsetting the increase in our cost of materials\nconsumed. Other factors such as efficient design changes, commodity price reduction and multi-sourcing supplies\nfor reduced acquisition costs, also partially offset the increase in our total cost of materials consumed. The cost of\nmaterials consumed represented 88% and 85% of our total income in Fiscal Years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nPurchase of stock-in-trade\nOur purchase of stock-in-trade decreased to ₹279 million in Fiscal Year 2024 from ₹923 million in Fiscal Year\n2023, as we began recognising the cost of chargers, whose prices were included within the price of E2Ws from\nApril 13, 2023 onwards, as cost of materials consumed.\nChange in inventories of finished goods, stock-in trade and work-in-progress\nClosing inventories levels of finished goods, stock-in-trade and work-in progress decreased to ₹178 million as at\nMarch 31, 2024 from ₹456 million as at March 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in sales of our E2Ws and\naccessories in the last quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. This resulted in the recognition of changes in the inventories\nof finished goods, stock-in trade and work-in-progress of ₹247 million in Fiscal Year 2024 as compared to ₹339\nmillion for Fiscal Year 2023.\nEmployee benefits expenses\nOur employee benefits expenses increased to ₹3,692 million in Fiscal Year 2024 from ₹3,348 million in Fiscal\nYear 2023 primarily due to an increase in the salaries and welfare expenses paid to our employees. This increase\nwas partially offset by the fully and semi-automated manufacturing processes, which led to the creation of\noperating efficiencies among our workforce.

In such cases, the\ntransaction price allocated towards such service or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone\nselling price and is recognised as a contract liability until the service obligation has been met. The price that is\nregularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the\nabsence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate the standalone selling price is the expected cost\nplus a margin, under which we estimate the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then add an\nappropriate margin based on similar services.\nSale of services include certain performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time. Any amount\nreceived in advance in respect of such performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time is recorded\nas a contract liability and recorded as revenue when service is rendered to customers. Refund liabilities comprise\nof obligation towards customers to pay for discounts and sales incentives.\nRevenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for variable consideration\non account of discounts and other incentives, if any, that we offer as a part of the contract with the customer.\nRevenue also excludes taxes or other amounts collected from customers. No element of financing is deemed\npresent as the sale of goods / services are primarily on a “Cash and Carry” basis.\nContract balances\nTrade receivables\nWe recognise a receivable when the goods are delivered to the customer as this represents the point of time at\nwhich the right to consideration becomes unconditional, as only the passage of time is required before payment\ndue.\nContract liabilities\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods to a customer for which we have received consideration.

Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when we perform under the contract.\nWarranty obligation\nWe provide warranties for general repairs of defects as per the terms of the contract with our ultimate customers.\nThese warranties are considered as assurance-type warranties and are accounted for under Ind AS 37- Provisions,\nContingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\nOther income\nInterest income is recognised on an accrual basis. For all debt instruments measured at amortised cost, interest\nincome is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the amount outstanding and effective interest\nrate.\nDividend income is accounted for when the right to receive it is established.\nProvision and contingencies\nA provision is recognised when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event; it is\nprobable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate\ncan be made. Provisions are determined based on best estimate required to settle the obligation at the reporting\ndate. These are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Where a provision\nis measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value\nof those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material). When some or all of the economic\nbenefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third-party, a receivable is recognised\nas an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount receivable can be measured\n425",

While the decrease as at March 31,\n2024 was primarily due to a reduction in inventories and other financial assets mainly from a decrease in FAME\nsubsidy receivables. The reduction in the FAME subsidy receivables was due to the decrease in the maximum\namount of incentives available from ₹15,000 per kWh as at May 31, 2023 to ₹10,000 per kWh from June 1, 2023,\nand release of the FAME subsidy by the authority in the last quarter of the Fiscal Year 2024\nOur total equity increased from ₹2,249 million as at March 31, 2022 to ₹6,137 million as at March 31, 2023 and\ndecreased to ₹5,459 million as at March 31, 2024. The increase as at March 31, 2023 was primarily due to the\nissuance of compulsorily convertible preference shares and equity shares of ₹11,998 million during Fiscal Year\n2023, which was partially offset by our loss before tax of ₹8,645 million, while the decrease as at March 31, 2024\nwas primarily a result of our operating loss, which led to a decrease in retained earnings.\nOur total non-current liabilities increased from ₹1,993 million as at March 31, 2022 to ₹3,436 million as at March\n31, 2023 and decreased to ₹2,912 million as at March 31, 2024. The increase as at March 31, 2023 was primarily\ndue to an increase in lease liabilities as a result of a new lease agreement for the expansion of our Hosur Factory,\nR&D facilities and corporate office, increased borrowings and an increase in our warranty and employee\nprovisions, while the decrease as at March 31, 2024 was primarily due to the repayment of our borrowings and\npayment of lease liabilities.\nOur total current liabilities increased from ₹3,944 million as at March 31, 2022 to ₹10,195 million as at March\n31, 2023 and increased to ₹10,764 million as at March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in\nus availing credit facilities to meet working capital requirements, advances received from customers and\noutstanding dues of creditors.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our primary liquidity requirements have been to finance our working capital needs for our operations\nand capital expenditures. We have met these requirements through additional equity infusions and borrowings.\nAs at March 31, 2024, we had ₹2,279 million in cash and cash equivalents, ₹2,199 million as other balances with\nbanks, ₹2,781 million in investment in liquid mutual funds, ₹309 million in non-current borrowings and ₹2,840\nmillion in current borrowings. We believe that, after taking into account the expected cash to be generated from\nour operations, our borrowings and proceeds from this Offering, we will have sufficient liquidity for our present\nrequirements and anticipated requirements for capital expenditure and working capital for the next 12 months.\nCash Flows\nThe table below summarises the statement of cash flows, as per our restated cash flow statements, for the Fiscal\nYears indicated:\nFiscal Year\n2024 2023 2022\n(in ₹ million)\nNet cash used in operating activities (2,676) (8,713) (2,284)\nNet cash used in from investing activities (2,281) (1,350) (66)\nNet cash generated from financing activities 6,332 13,174 2,307\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash 1,375 3,111 (43)\nequivalents\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for Fiscal Year 2024 was ₹2,676 million, while our operating cash outflow\nbefore working capital changes was ₹7,038 million. The difference was primarily attributable to a decrease in\nother financial assets of ₹2,512 million, a decrease in inventories of ₹1,407 million and an increase in other\nliabilities and provisions of ₹1,279 million.

If any indication\nexists, we then estimate the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s\nor cash-generating unit’s (“CGU”) net selling price and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined\nfor an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from\nother assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount,\nthe asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Intangible assets with indefinite\nuseful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever\nthere is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\nIn determining net selling price, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such\ntransactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\nWe base our impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately\nfor each of our CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are\ngenerally covering a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to\nproject future cash flows after the fifth year.\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised\nimpairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, we then estimate the\nasset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been\na change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was\nrecognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount,\nnor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss\nbeen recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the restated statement of profit and loss\nunless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.\nAfter impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful\nlife.\nRevenue from contract with customers and other income\nRevenue from contract with customers\nRevenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers for an amount that\nreflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Revenue excludes\ntaxes or duties collected on behalf of the Government.\n• Sale of products\nWe recognise revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable\nconsideration), when we satisfy our performance obligation at a point of time in which the products are delivered\nto customers. This is when control, including risks, rewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, and when\nthere is no longer any unfulfilled obligation. The transaction price of goods sold is net of variable consideration\non account of various discounts and schemes that we offer as part of the contract.\nWe offer sales incentives in the form of variable marketing expense to customers, which vary depending on the\ntiming and any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted for as a revenue reduction and is\nconstrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of revenue recognised when any associated\nuncertainty is subsequently resolved. We estimate the expected sales incentive by market and consider\nuncertainties such as competitor pricing, ageing of retailer stock and local market conditions.\n424\n\n[TABLES]\n| Description of assets |  |  | Useful life and basis of amortisation |",

Pursuant to the relevant UPI\nCirculars, the UPI Mechanism has been introduced in a phased manner as a payment mechanism (in addition to\nmechanism of blocking funds in the account maintained with SCSBs under ASBA) for applications by UPI Bidder\nthrough Designated Intermediaries with the objective to reduce the time duration from public issue closure to\nlisting from six Working Days to up to three Working Days. Considering the time required for making necessary\nchanges to the systems and to ensure complete and smooth transition to the UPI payment mechanism, the UPI\nCirculars have introduced and implemented the UPI Mechanism in three phases in the following manner:\nPhase I: This phase was applicable from January 1, 2019 until March 31, 2019 or floating of five main board\npublic issues, whichever was later. Subsequently, the timeline for implementation of Phase I was extended until\nJune 30, 2019. Under this phase, an RII had the option to submit the ASBA Form with any of the Designated\nIntermediary and use his/her UPI ID for the purpose of blocking of funds. The time duration from public issue\nclosure to listing continued to be six Working Days.\nPhase II: This phase has become applicable from July 1, 2019 and was to initially continue for a period of three\nmonths or floating of five main board public issues, whichever is later. SEBI pursuant to its circular no.\nSEBI/HO/CFD/DCR2/CIR/P/2019/133 dated November 8, 2019, had decided to extend the timeline for\nimplementation of UPI Phase II until March 31, 2020. Subsequently, SEBI pursuant to its circular no.\nSEBI/HO/CFD/DIL2/CIR/P/2020/50 dated March 30, 2020 extended the timeline for implementation of UPI\nPhase II till further notice. Under this phase, submission of the ASBA Form by RIIs through Designated\nIntermediaries (other than SCSBs) to SCSBs for blocking of funds was discontinued and replaced by the UPI\nMechanism. However, the time duration from public issue closure to listing continued to be six Working Days\nduring this phase.\nPhase III: This phase has become applicable on a voluntary basis for all issues opening on or after September 1,\n2023 and on a mandatory basis for all issues opening on or after December 1, 2023, vide SEBI circular bearing\nnumber SEBI/HO/CFD/TPD1/CIR/P/2023/140 dated August 9, 2023 (“T+3 Notification”).

Foreign investment is permitted (except in the prohibited sectors) in Indian companies, either\nthrough the automatic route or the approval route, depending upon the sector in which foreign investment is sought\nto be made. The Government of India makes policy announcements on FDI through press notes and press releases.\nThe regulatory framework, over a period of time, thus, consists of acts, regulations, press notes, press releases,\nand clarifications among other amendments. The DPIIT (formerly Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion)\nissued the Consolidated FDI Policy Circular dated October 15, 2020, with effect from October 15, 2020 (the “FDI\nPolicy”), which consolidates and supersedes all previous press note, press releases and clarifications on FDI issued\nby the DPIIT that were in force and effect prior to October 15, 2020.\nIn terms of Press Note 3 of 2020, dated April 17, 2020 (“Press Note”), issued by the DPIIT, the FDI Policy and\nthe FEMA Non-Debt Instruments Rules have been amended to state that all investments under the foreign direct\ninvestment route by entities of a country which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an\ninvestment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country will require prior approval of the Government\nof India. Further, in the event of transfer of ownership of any existing or future foreign direct investment in an\nentity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the aforesaid restriction/\npurview, such subsequent change in the beneficial ownership will also require approval of the Government of\nIndia. Pursuant to the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) (Fourth Amendment) Rules, 2020,\na multilateral bank or fund, of which India is a member, shall not be treated as an entity of a particular country\nnor shall any country be treated as the beneficial owner of the investments of such bank or fund in India.

In the event such prior\napproval of the Government of India is required, and such approval has been obtained, the Bidder shall intimate\nour Company and the Registrar to the Offer in writing about such approval along with a copy thereof within the\nBid/ Offer Period.\nIn accordance with the FEMA Non-Debt Instruments Rules and the FDI Policy read with the Press Note, 100%\nforeign direct investment is permitted under the automatic route for companies in the “manufacturing” sector.\nFurther, the transfer of shares between an Indian resident and a non-resident does not require the prior approval\nof the RBI, provided that (i) the activities of the investee company are under the automatic route under the FDI\nPolicy and transfer does not attract the provisions of the SEBI Takeover Regulations; (ii) the non-resident\nshareholding is within the sectoral limits under the FDI Policy; and (iii) the pricing is in accordance with the\nguidelines prescribed by the SEBI/RBI.\nFor details of the aggregate limit for investments by NRIs and FPIs in our Company, see “Offer Procedure – Bids\nby Eligible Non-resident Indians” and “Offer Procedure – Bids by Foreign Portfolio Investors” on page 482\nand 482, respectively.\nAs per the existing policy of the Government of India, OCBs cannot participate in this Offer.\nThe Equity Shares offered in the Offer have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or\nany state securities laws in the United States and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold within the United\nStates, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of\nthe U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
