In\nparticular, we have also incurred an increase in depreciation and amortisation costs, amounting to ₹ 638.89 million, ₹ 472.74\nmillion and ₹ 240.45 million in Fiscal 2024, Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, respectively, which is attributable to the expansion\nof our manufacturing facilities, warehouse infrastructure, and COCO – Regular Store network. For more details, see\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Fiscal\n2024 compared to Fiscal 2023” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n– Results of Operations – Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022” on page 354 and 356, respectively. We have expended and\nexpect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on, among others, advertising and business promotion\ncosts to attract customers. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth\nin our business. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could\nprevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results\nof operations could be adversely affected. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses and\ncash flows, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future.\n5. Our inability to accurately manage inventory and forecast demand for our products may have an adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDemand for our products is forecasted using past trends and anticipated demand. We use various data tools to capture sales\ninformation, customer behaviour and other metrics from our various sales and marketing channels. This data is then analysed\nand used to design new products, decide inventory levels, create manufacturing schedules, optimise raw material purchasing\nand also used as an input in many other aspects of our business cycle. Any inaccuracy or our inability to accurately collect and\nanalyse this data may result in our forecasts and estimates as well as business plans to be inaccurate and incorrect. If we fail to\naccurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale.\nIf we underestimate demand, we may manufacture fewer quantities of products than required, which could result in the loss of\nbusiness and dissatisfied customers, which could adversely affect our goodwill. If we overestimate demand, any unsold\ninventory may have to be sold at a discount or discarded, potentially leading to losses. We cannot assure you that we will be\nable to sell surplus stock in a timely manner, or at all, which in turn may adversely affect our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and cash flows. While we have experienced inventory write downs due to surplus stock in the nine months\nperiod ended December 31, 2024 and the last three Fiscals, such inventory write downs did not have a material impact on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and we cannot guarantee that such instances will not arise in\nthe future.\nThe table below sets forth details of certain parameters as of the dates indicated:\nParticulars As of December 31, As of March 31,\n2024 2024 2023 2022\nInventories (₹ million) 1,926.31 1,306.83 1,155.85 1,370.20\nTotal current assets (₹ million) 5,771.11 5,741.18 3,855.80 2 ,841.14\nInventories as a percentage of 33.38% 22.76% 29.98% 48.23%\nTotal current assets (%)\nInventory turnover ratio(1) 2.68 3.78 3.69 3.50\nNet working capital days(2) 11.92 6.89 20.44 27.36\nNotes:\n1.

We do not have long term agreements with suppliers for our raw materials and an increase in the cost of or a shortfall\nin the availability of such raw materials could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows.\nOur primary raw materials are chemicals, natural wood, processed wood, fabrics, glue and metal goods. The cost of our products\nis dependent on our ability to source these raw materials at acceptable prices and maintain a stable and sufficient supply of such\nraw materials.

In the event real estate prices increase or if we are unable to renew\nlease/leave and license agreements for our existing COCO – Regular Stores on terms favourable to us, such store locations may\nnot be profitable for our business, and we may be compelled to reassess the feasibility of such stores. Further, our future revenue\ngrowth depends upon the successful operation of our COCO Stores, the efficiency of our supply chain management systems\nand the successful management of our sales, marketing, and support and service teams in various states across India where our\ncustomers are located. The expansion of our business may require that we establish COCO Stores and manage businesses in\nwidely disparate states with different statutory, legal and regulatory framework.

Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could adversely affect\nour business, results of operations and financial condition and prospects. Further, as we expand our network of COCO Stores,\nwe anticipate an increase in rent expenses. If we are unable to generate adequate revenues from new stores, the increased rent\nexpenses could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur COCO Stores may experience varying levels of revenue and sales performance due to factors such as location-specific\ndemand, seasonal trends, competitive dynamics, and economic conditions in the respective regions. Due to these factors, some\nof our COCO Stores may outperform while others may underperform. A consistent decline in revenue from any particular\nCOCO Stores may necessitate their closure. Frequent closures may adversely affect brand perception and customer trust in the\naffected regions, potentially resulting in a loss of customer loyalty. In the last three Fiscals and nine-months period ended\nDecember 31, 2024, we have closed seven COCO – Regular Stores. These closures were primarily due to low revenue\ngeneration and/or the strategic relocation of these stores to other locations within same or similar catchment area. While we\nmonitor the performance of our COCO – Regular Stores and implement strategies to enhance their profitability, we cannot\nassure you that future closures will not be necessary or that such actions will not have an adverse impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn addition, we derive a portion of our revenues from MBOs where multiple brands’ products are sold and the same are operated\nby third parties. We cannot assure you that these MBOs will consistently meet our standards for customer service. If they fail\nto do so, it could lead to customer dissatisfaction and negative reviews, which may in turn reduce our brand reputation and\nsales.

The absence of long term contracts at fixed prices exposes us to volatility in\nthe prices of raw materials that we require and we may be unable to pass these costs onto our consumers. We also face a risk\nthat one or more of our existing suppliers may discontinue their supplies to us, and any inability on our part to procure raw\nmaterials from alternate suppliers in a timely fashion, or on terms acceptable to us, may adversely affect our operations. While\nwe have not experienced material disruption in the supply of our raw materials in the nine months period ended December 31,\n2024 and the last three Fiscals which had an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows, we cannot assure you that such disruption will not occur in the future and if any such disruption occurs, such disruption\nmay result in unexpected increases in prices of our raw materials and packaging material costs.\nWe import certain of our raw materials, including toluene diisocyanate, polymer polyol, base polyol, cell opener and wood\nfrom various countries such as the United State of America, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand.\nThe table below provides our cost of imported materials as a percentage of our total purchases of raw materials in the period/\nyears indicated:\nParticulars Nine months period Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nended December 31,\n2024\nCost of imported materials (₹ 1,115.55 1,046.29 988.38 1,435.48\nmillion)\nCost of imported materials as a 22.74% 21.90% 22.48% 33.70%\npercentage of total purchases of raw\nmaterials\nAny restrictions imposed by the Government of India on the import of such raw materials or any embargoes on the jurisdictions\nwhere our suppliers are located, or any increases in import duties on these raw materials, may adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and prospects. While we have not faced any such restrictions on the import of required raw materials in\nthe nine months period ended December 31, 2024 and in the last three fiscal years which had an adverse impact on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows, we cannot assure that these issues will not arise in the future. We are\nalso subject to the risks associated with changing international trade policies, including the imposition of anti-dumping duties.\nAnti-dumping duties can increase the cost of imported raw materials, making our products less competitive in the market, which\ncould have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n7. We rely on third party logistics service providers to transport our products, and any disruption in our transportation\narrangements or increases in transportation costs may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows.\nWe rely on third party logistics service providers to transport our products between our manufacturing facilities and intermediate\ndelivery points such as our warehouses, retail stores and inventory holding points, or to transport some of our products to our\ncustomers. We transport our finished products by road and sea. Transportation strikes may have an adverse effect on supplies\nand deliveries to our customers. In addition, our products may be lost or damaged in transit for various reasons including\noccurrence of accidents, natural disasters or adverse weather conditions. There may also be a delay in delivery of our products\nwhich may also affect our business and results of operation negatively.

If we fail to obtain some or all of these approvals or licenses, or renewals thereof, in a timely manner\nor at all, or if we fail to comply with applicable conditions or it is claimed that we have breached any such conditions, our\nlicense or permission for carrying on a particular activity may be suspended or cancelled and consequently we may not be able\nto carry on such activity, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the past, we have had an instance where our GST registration in Andhra Pradesh was suspended as the principal place of\nbusiness recorded in the registration certificate was not updated. However, the matter was resolved and the suspension was\nsubsequently revoked. Further, in the past we have received show cause notices under the provisions of the Water (Prevention\nand Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1982 alleging non-compliance with\ncertain conditions of the consent to establish with respect to Manufacturing Facility V. While we have responded to these\nnotices, no further action has been taken against us. We cannot assure you that similar incidents will not arise in the future or\nany further actions will not be taken against us in relation to such notices.\nWe have and may need to in the future, apply for certain additional approvals, including the renewal of approvals, which may\nexpire from time to time. We have, inter alia, made applications for certain approvals which are pending as on the date of this\nDraft Red Herring Prospectus. For instance, we have applied for authorizations under the Hazardous & Other Wastes\n(Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, in relation to certain of our Manufacturing Facilities, registration of\nestablishment under the respective state shops and establishment acts, trade licenses, under the respective municipal corporation\nacts for certain of our COCO – Regular Stores. For details, see “Government and Other Approvals” on page 371. We cannot\nassure you that such approvals and licenses will be granted or renewed in a timely manner or will not be cancelled or withdrawn\nby the relevant governmental or regulatory authorities. Failure to obtain or renew such approvals and licenses in a timely manner\nwould make our operations non-compliant with applicable laws and may result in the imposition of penalties by relevant\nauthorities and may also prevent us from carrying out our business.\n21. We have incurred indebtedness and an inability to obtain further financing or to comply with repayment and other\ncovenants in our financing agreements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition\nand cash flows.\nWe have entered into various financing arrangements with various lenders for short-term and long terms facilities.

For further details, see “Objects of the Offer - Capital expenditure to be incurred by our Company for setting up of 117\nnew COCO – Regular Stores and one COCO – Jumbo Store” on page 112.\nWhile this strategy of opening smaller-sized COCO – Regular Stores offers opportunities for market expansion and increased\ncustomer reach, it also introduces several risks that could impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\ncash flows. Smaller stores may have limited floor space, which could restrict the variety and quantity of products displayed.\nThis might result in lower sales volumes compared to larger stores, especially if the smaller size limits the ability to showcase\na comprehensive range of products. A smaller store may not provide the same level of customer experience as a larger store.\nLimited space could affect the layout and ambiance, potentially impacting customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nFurthermore, smaller stores may require different operational strategies, including efficient space utilization, streamlined\ninventory management, and tailored staffing levels. Given that we do not have prior experience operating such smaller-sized\nstores, we may face challenges in effectively managing these aspects. If we are unable to do so, it could have an adverse impact\non the performance of these stores and, consequently, on our overall business, results of operations, financial condition, and\ncash flows.\n27. Our business is manpower intensive. Our business may be adversely affected by work stoppages, strikes, lockouts,\nincreased wage demands by our employees, or an increase in minimum wages, and if we are unable to engage new\nemployees at commercially attractive terms.\nOur operations are manpower intensive and we are dependent on our workforce for a significant portion of our operations. The\nsuccess of our operations depends on the availability of and maintaining good relationships with our workforce. Shortage of\nworkforce or disruptions caused by disagreements with workforce could have an adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows. While we have not experienced any labour unrest in the nine months period\nended December 31, 2024 and the last three Fiscals, which had an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows, we cannot assure you that we will not experience disruptions in work or our operations due to disputes,\nstrikes, work stoppages, work slow-downs or lockouts at our manufacturing units or other problems with our work force, which\nmay adversely affect our ability to continue our business operations. Any labour unrest could directly or indirectly prevent or\nhinder our normal operating activities, and, if not resolved in a timely manner, could lead to disruptions in our operations.\nOur success also depends on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain skilled manufacturing personnel. Our inability to recruit,\ntrain and retain suitably qualified and skilled personnel could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows. As at December 31, 2024, we were supported by 2,085 employees out of which 1,504 were employees\n(excluding skilled and unskilled labours) and 581 were skilled and unskilled labours.

Further, we are subject to stringent labour laws,\nand any violation of these laws may lead regulators or other authorities to order a suspension of certain or all of our operations.\nWe may need to increase compensation and other benefits either to attract and retain key personnel or due to increased wage\ndemands by our employees, or an increase in minimum wages and that may adversely affect our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and cash flows.

Additionally, our inability to obtain adequate amount of working capital at such terms which are\nfavourable to us and in a timely manner or at all may also have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Continued increases\nin our working capital requirements may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and\ncash flows.\n16. Sales of our products are affected by seasonality, particularly during the festive season during which our sales are\ncomparatively higher, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nSales of our products are affected by seasonality, particularly during the festive season during which our sales are comparatively\nhigher. As a result, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate from period to period and comparisons of our revenue and\nresults of operations within a single Fiscal or in different Fiscals may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied\non as indicators of our performance for any future fiscal period. Further, demand for our products, including mattresses,\nfurniture, and furnishings, tends to increase significantly during these periods. If we are unable to accurately forecast and\nmanage this increased demand, we may face stockouts or delayed deliveries.

The failure to successfully integrate the operations or otherwise to\nrealise any of the anticipated benefits of the planned acquisitions could seriously harm our business, results of operations,\nfinancial conditions and cash flows.\n29. We engage in foreign currency transactions and fluctuations in the exchange rate between the rupee and other\ncurrencies may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur financial statements are presented in Rupees.

For further details, see “Objects of the Offer –\nCapital expenditure to be incurred by the Company for purchase of new equipment and machinery” on page 118. We may\nencounter various challenges such as issues with procurement of the equipment or machinery and increased costs of equipment.\nIf there are significant cost overruns, the overall benefit of such capital expenditure to our revenues and profitability may\ndecline. If the expenditure that we incur does not produce anticipated or desired results, our profitability and financial condition\nwill be adversely affected.\n23. If we fail to protect or incur significant costs in defending our intellectual property or if we infringe the intellectual\nproperty rights of others, our business, results of operation, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely\naffected.\nAs of the date of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus, we had registered 78 trademarks under class 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18,\n20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 37, 41, 42, 43 with the Registrar of Trademarks under the Trademarks Act, 1999.

Further, we have registered one trademark in the United Kingdom, one trademark\nin Australia and have made six applications outside India through the World Intellectual Property Organization procedure,\nincluding Oman, Japan, USA, Singapore, Canada and UAE which are currently pending.\nFor further details, see “Our Business – Intellectual Property” on page 214. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability\nto protect these intellectual property and other proprietary rights that we may develop. We rely primarily on patents, trademarks\nand anti-trust laws, as well as other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nDespite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property\nor otherwise gaining access to our technology. In the past, we have had instances where products were listed on certain online\nplatforms with names that infringed on our trademarks. To address this, we submitted ‘take-down’ requests to the relevant\nonline platforms, to ensure the protection of our intellectual property. Further, in the past, we identified certain trademark\napplications that were similar to our registered trademarks. To address this, we issued cease and desist notices to the relevant\nparties and also initiated opposition proceedings before the relevant authorities. Certain of our notices of opposition submitted\nunder the Trade Marks Act, 1999 continue to be pending before the relevant authorities. Further, we have also received notices\nof opposition from third parties against certain marks that we intend to register as our trademark. We cannot assure you that the\naforesaid instances will not arise in the future. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, then\nour business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWhile we ensure that we comply with the intellectual property rights of others, we cannot determine with certainty whether we\nare infringing any existing third-party intellectual property rights. We have in the past and are currently subject to certain\nproceedings initiated by third-parties, alleging infringement of their intellectual property. Further, we have received an email\nnotice from Snoozer Bedding Limited, alleging infringement of its registered trademark, to which have responded on March 7,\n2025.

Our Company responded to this notice on April 30, 2025. Any claims of intellectual property infringement from\nthird parties, regardless of merit or resolution of such claims, could force us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending\nand resolving such claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel away from our\nbusiness. As a result of such infringement claims, we could be required to pay third party infringement claims, alter our\ntechnologies, obtain licenses or cease some portions of our operations.\n24.

The home and furnishings industry is competitive and our inability to compete effectively may adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe home and furnishings industry in India is competitive, fragmented and largely unorganised and faces certain threats and\nchallenges that impact scalability and profitability. Economic sensitivity, discretionary spending risks, and supply chain\ndisruptions due to inflation and geopolitical issues may erode margins and disrupt operations. Regulatory and environmental\ncompliance adds complexity, while intense competition and the bulky nature of products create logistical hurdles and limit\nrepeat purchases. Given the inherently low barriers to entry in these markets, a significant proportion of the home solutions\nproducts industry in India, and in particular, the mattresses and furniture industries is unorganised, with competitors running\nunbranded and smaller scale operations. Our unorganised competitors may incur lesser operating expenses, given the size and\nscale of their operations and have a deeper retail reach in the territories that they operate in, than us. We cannot assure you that\nwe can effectively compete with entities in the unorganised markets.\nWe also compete with various organised players in the home and furnishings industry. Some of our competitors may be larger\nthan us, have more financial and other resources and have products with greater brand recognition than ours. Our competitors\nin certain regions may also have better access to raw materials required in our operations and may procure them at lower costs\nthan us, and consequently be able to sell their products at lower prices. Some of our competitors may also sell inferior quality\nproducts at lower prices, thereby increasing pricing pressure on us. This competitive pricing strategy can lead to a perception\nof higher costs associated with our products, potentially driving customers towards cheaper alternatives. As a result, we cannot\nassure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors or that our\nbusiness and results of operations will not be adversely affected by increased competition. Increased competition may lead to\na reduction in our market share as competitors may introduce innovative products and employ aggressive pricing strategies. In\naddition, our competitors may significantly increase their advertising and brand building activities to promote their brands and\nproducts, which may require us to similarly increase our advertising and marketing expenses and engage in effective pricing\nstrategies, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

For further information, see “Our Business - Business Operations - Quality Assurance and Quality Control” on page\n213. In particular, advanced sleep tech products such as Track8 and Regul8 expose us to risks related to product malfunctions,\nwhich necessitate stringent quality control processes to ensure product reliability. We cannot assure you that our quality\nstandards will be adhered to, and if they are not, that our quality control processes and inspections will accurately detect all\ndeficiencies in the quality of our products at all times, before such products reach the customers. We have, from time to time,\ndue to quality defects, replaced or accepted returns of products sold to our customers in accordance with our replacements and\nreturns policy. In the event the quality of our products is not in accordance with our standards or our products are defective, our\ncustomers may return our products, we may be required to recall or replace such products at additional cost to us and our\nreputation may be impacted. Also, see “Risk Factors - We provide product warranties and, if our product warranty obligations\nare significantly in excess of our warranty provisions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.” on page 42.\nIn addition, material quality issues can expose us to product liability claims in the event that our products fail to meet the\nrequired quality standards, or are alleged to cause harm to customers. We face the risk of legal proceedings and product liability\nclaims being brought against us by our consumers, for various reasons including for defective products sold. We have not been\nsubject to any legal proceedings in relation to the product liability claims in the nine months period ended December 31, 2024\nand the last three Fiscals which had an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not experience any product liability claims in the future or that we will not incur significant\ncosts to defend any such claims.

The table below sets forth\ndetails of the insurance amount claimed and insurance amount received for the period/years indicated:\nParticulars Nine months period Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nended December 31,\n2024\nInsurance amount claimed 0.17 Nil 0.52 19.17\n(₹ million)\nInsurance amount received 0.15 Nil 0.45 18.67*\n(₹ million)\n*The amount was received in Fiscal 2023 however it has been shown in the above table under Fiscal 2022 to correlate it with the insurance\namount claimed.\nTo the extent that we suffer any loss or damage that is not covered by insurance or exceeds our insurance coverage, our business,\ncash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any damage suffered by us in excess of\nsuch limited coverage amounts, or in respect of uninsured events, not covered by such insurance policies will have to be borne\nby us. While we have not experienced any instance where we incurred losses exceeding our insurance coverage in the nine\nmonths period ended December 31, 2024 and the last three Fiscals, we cannot assure you that such instance will not arise in the\nfuture.\n25. We have never operated COCO – Jumbo Stores in the past. Our lack of experience in operating such stores may impact\nour business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe intend to set up COCO – Jumbo Stores, in India, with an estimated size ranging between 50,000 square feet to 200,000\nsquare feet to offer a comprehensive range of our products. While these COCO – Jumbo Stores will be set up across multiple\ngeographical locations, we will be starting with two COCO – Jumbo Stores to be set up and opened in Bengaluru, India. Of the\ntwo COCO – Jumbo Stores, one will be funded through a portion of our Net Proceeds and the other through internal\naccruals. For further details, see “Objects of the Offer – Capital expenditure to be incurred by our Company for setting\nup of 117 new COCO – Regular Stores and one COCO – Jumbo Store” on page 112. Since we do not have any past\nexperience in opening and operating a retail store of this size and magnitude, this initiative presents several significant\nrisks.\nWe may face challenges from an operational perspective, as managing such large stores will require expertise in areas\nsuch as space management and inventory control. Efficiently managing a store of this scale requires timely restocking,\nand maintaining optimal inventory levels to meet customer demand without overstocking. Staffing a large store requires\ncareful planning to ensure adequate coverage during peak times while avoiding unnecessary labour costs during slower\nperiods. Given our lack of prior experience, we may face challenges in these areas, leading to inefficiencies and higher\noperational costs.\nFurther, there is a risk that the market may not respond as expected to the opening of these large-format stores. If we are\nunable to generate proportionate revenues to cover the increased costs associated with these stores, it could negatively\nimpact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We cannot assure you that the market\ndemand will be sufficient to support the sales volumes needed to achieve profitability from these stores.\n26. Our change in strategy to open smaller sized COCO – Regular Stores in the future may have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe propose to utilise a portion of the Net Proceeds towards the capital expenditure to be incurred by our Company for setting\nup 117 new COCO – Regular Stores in India. As on December 31, 2024, the average size of our COCO – Regular Stores\n(aggregate area divided by number of active COCO – Regular Stores) is 3,440.90 square feet per COCO – Regular Store. We\nintend to open COCO – Regular Stores of varied sizes, tailored to specific catchment areas for mattress, furniture and\nfurnishings products. We also intend to tap into smaller cities and towns and underserved pockets of metropolitan cities in\n47\n\n[TABLES]\nParticulars |  | Nine months period |  | Fiscal 2024 | Fiscal 2023 | Fiscal 2022\n |  | ended December 31, |  |  |  | \n |  | 2024 |  |  |  | \nCoverage of insurance\npolicies (₹ million) | 16,764.38 |  |  | 10,829.07 | 9,323.47 | 4,801.13\nCoverage of insurance\npolicies as a percentage\nof total insurable assets* | 373.41% |  |  | 301.59% | 303.36% | 162.94%\nParticulars |  | Nine months period |  | Fiscal 2024 | Fiscal 2023 | Fiscal 2022\n |  | ended December 31, |  |  |  | \n |  | 2024 |  |  |  | \nInsurance amount claimed\n(₹ million) | 0.17 |  |  | Nil | 0.52 | 19.17\nInsurance amount received\n(₹ million) | 0.15 |  |  | Nil | 0.45 | 18.67*\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Of the\ntwo COCO | Jumbo Stores, one will be funded through a portion of our Net Proceeds and the other through internal |  |  |  |  |  |  | \naccruals.

The funding\nrequirements disclosed as a part of the objects of the Offer are based on internal management estimates in view of past\nexpenditures and have not been appraised by any bank or financial institution. These are based on current conditions and are\nsubject to change in light of changes in external circumstances, costs, other financial conditions or business strategies. Our\nmanagement, in accordance with the policies established by our Board of Directors from time to time, will have flexibility in\ndeploying the Net Proceeds of the Offer. Based on the competitive nature of our industry, we may have to revise our business\nplan and/or management estimates from time to time and consequently our funding requirements may also change. Our\nmanagement estimates may differ from the value that would have been determined by third party appraisals, which may require\nus to reschedule or reallocate our expenditure, subject to applicable laws, and may have an adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVarious risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in this section as well as in “Objects of the Offer” beginning on page\n111, may limit or delay our efforts to use the Net Proceeds to achieve profitable growth in our business. For example, the modes\nwe shall utilize to undertake expenditures and investments towards our advertising and marketing strategies are not specific or\nidentified at this stage. Further, the outcome of this expenditure and investment is not ascertainable or quantifiable at this stage\nand may be disproportionate to the revenue generated or consumer conversion rates. Similarly, we are also yet to identify the\nexact locations or enter into agreements for lease/ leave and license/sub-lease of properties for the COCO – Regular Stores and\none of the COCO – Jumbo Stores which we intend to utilize the Net Proceeds towards the setting up of. While we have included\nestimated capital expenditure for the setting up of such COCO – Regular Stores and COCO – Jumbo Store of estimated size on\nthe basis of quotations, we have not yet placed any orders for expenditure to be incurred for setting up the COCO – Regular\nStores and the COCO – Jumbo Store. As a consequence of any increased costs, our actual deployment of funds may be higher\nthan our management estimates. We may also face delays or incur additional costs due to failure to receive regulatory approvals,\ntechnical difficulties, human resource, technological or other resource constraints, or for other unforeseen reasons, events or\ncircumstances. Further, we may not be able to attract personnel with sufficient skills or sufficiently train our personnel to\nmanage our expansion plans. Accordingly, the use of Net Proceeds for other purposes identified by our management may not\nresult in actual growth of our business, increased profitability or an increase in the value of our business and your investment.\n31. Any variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds would be subject to certain compliance requirements, including\nprior shareholders' approval.\nWe propose to utilize the Net Proceeds towards the following: (i) capital expenditure to be incurred by our Company for setting\nup of 117 new COCO – Regular Stores and one COCO – Jumbo Store; (ii) expenditure for lease, sub-lease rent and license fee\npayments for our existing COCO – Regular Stores; (iii) capital expenditure to be incurred by our Company for purchase of new\nequipment and machinery ; (iv) marketing and advertisement expenses towards enhancing the awareness and visibility of our\nbrand and (v) for general corporate purposes. For further information of the proposed objects of the Offer, see “Objects of the\nOffer” on page 111. At this stage, we cannot determine with any certainty if we would require the Net Proceeds to meet any\nother expenditure or fund any exigencies arising out of competitive environment, business conditions, economic conditions or\nother factors beyond our control. In accordance with Sections 13(8) and 27 of the Companies Act 2013, we cannot undertake\nany variation in the utilization of the Net Proceeds without obtaining the shareholders’ approval through a special resolution.\nIn the event of any such circumstances that require us to undertake variation in the disclosed utilization of the Net Proceeds,\nwe may not be able to obtain the shareholders’ approval in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay or inability to obtain such\nshareholders’ approval may adversely affect our business or operations.\nIn light of these factors, we may not be able to undertake variation of objects of the Offer to use any unutilized proceeds of the\nOffer, if any or vary the terms of any contract referred to in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus, even if such variation is in the\ninterest of our Company. This may restrict our Company's ability to respond to any change in our business or financial condition\nby re-deploying the unutilized portion of the Net Proceeds, if any, or varying the terms of contract, which may adversely affect\nour business of operations.\n32. We are exposed to consumer complaints and our failure to address these complaints in a timely manner could lead to\nlitigation, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe receive complaints from our customers in the course of delivering our products to them. We receive such complaints through\nvarious portals including our website and customer helpline. Such complaints may be made against us on grounds of alleged\ndeficiency in products (arising from different perceptions of results compared to that marketed or advertised). We may also be\nliable for claims from our customers if our products are found to be defective or unfit for their intended purposes. In addition,\nwe may be subject to complaints based on malicious rumours regarding our products. Such events may generate negative\npublicity concerning our product quality, reduce consumers’ confidence in our products and negatively impact our reputation.\nAs a result, our business, profitability and financial performance may be adversely affected and we may also have to incur\nadditional costs to restore our image and reputation. In the event that complaints from our consumers escalate into legal claims,\nour image and market reputation could be adversely affected. In addition, resources such as time and legal costs would have to\nbe utilized and incurred to address such claims, thereby further affecting our business and financial performance. We cannot\n50",

It also mandates body corporates to adopt a privacy\npolicy, to obtain consent from data subjects for collecting or transferring their sensitive personal data or information and\nintimate them about recipients of such collected data, as a mechanism of establishing a robust security standard. The Information\nTechnology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“IT Intermediary Rules”) requires\nintermediaries receiving, storing, transmitting or providing any service with respect to electronic messages to not knowingly\nhost, publish, transmit, select or modify any information prohibited under these IT Intermediary Rules and to disable hosting,\npublishing, transmission, selection or modification of such information once they become aware of it, as well as specifying the\ndue diligence to be observed by intermediaries. The IT Intermediary Rules also make it mandatory for an intermediary to\npublish, the privacy policy, rules and regulations, and user agreement for access or usage of the intermediary's computer\nresource by any person on its website, and also establish a grievance redressal mechanism. Practices regarding the collection,\nuse, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come\nunder increased public scrutiny around the world.\nUncertainty in the applicability, interpretation or implementation of any amendment to, or change in, governing law, regulation\nor policy, including by reason of an absence, or a limited body, of administrative or judicial precedent may be time consuming\nas well as costly for us to resolve and may impact the viability of our current businesses or restrict our ability to grow our\nbusinesses in the future. For instance, the Supreme Court of India has in a decision clarified the components of basic wages\nwhich need to be considered by companies while making provident fund payments, which resulted in an increase in the\nprovident fund payments to be made by companies. Any such decisions in future or any further changes in interpretation of\nlaws may have an impact on our results of operations.\n54. Natural or man-made disasters, fires, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, terrorist attacks, civil unrest and other events\ncould materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, including cyclones, storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, fires, explosions,\npandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions, could adversely affect our results\nof operations, financial condition or cash flows. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect the\nIndian securities markets. In addition, any deterioration in international relations, especially between India and its neighbouring\ncountries, may result in investor concern regarding regional stability which could adversely affect the price of the Equity Shares.\nIn addition, India has witnessed local civil disturbances in recent years and it is possible that future civil unrest as well as other\nadverse social, economic or political events in India could have an adverse effect on our business. Such incidents could also\ncreate a greater perception that investment in Indian companies involves a higher degree of risk and could have an adverse\neffect on our business and the market price of the Equity Shares.\n55. A downgrade in ratings of India and other jurisdictions we operate in may affect the trading price of the Equity Shares.\nOur access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on the sovereign credit ratings of India. Any further adverse revisions\nto credit ratings for India and other jurisdictions we operate in by international rating agencies may adversely impact our ability\nto raise additional financing. This could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our growth on favourable terms and\nconsequently adversely affect our business and financial performance and the price of the Equity Shares.\n56. Political, economic or other factors that are beyond our control may have an adverse effect on our business and results\nof operations.\nWe are dependent on domestic, regional and global economic and market conditions. Our performance, growth and market\nprice of our Equity Shares are and will be dependent to a large extent on the health of the economy in which we operate. There\nhave been periods of slowdown in the economic growth of India. Demand for our products may be adversely affected by an\neconomic downturn in domestic, regional and global economies. Economic growth in the countries in which we operate is\naffected by various factors including domestic consumption and savings, balance of trade movements, namely export demand\nand movements in key imports (oil and oil products), global economic uncertainty and liquidity crisis, volatility in exchange\ncurrency rates, and annual rainfall which affects agricultural production. The recent hostility between India and Pakistan has\nfurther exacerbated regional economic uncertainty. Consequently, any future slowdown in the Indian economy could harm our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Also, a change in the government or a change in the economic\nand deregulation policies could adversely affect economic conditions prevalent in the areas in which we operate in general and\nour business in particular and high rates of inflation in India could increase our costs without proportionately increasing our\nrevenues, and as such decrease our operating margins.\n57. Significant differences exist between Ind AS and other accounting principles, such as U.S. GAAP and IFRS, which\ninvestors may be more familiar with and may consider material to their assessment of our financial condition.\nThe Restated Financial Information is prepared in accordance with Ind AS and restated in accordance with requirements of\nSection 26 of Part I of Chapter III of the Companies Act, 2013, the SEBI ICDR Regulations and the Guidance Note on “Reports\nin Company Prospectuses (Revised 2019)” issued by the ICAI and the requirements of the SEBI e-mail dated October 28, 2021,\n59",

The main objective of these measures is to alert and advice investors to\nbe extra cautious while dealing in these securities and advice market participants to carry out necessary due diligence while\ndealing in these securities. Accordingly, SEBI and Stock Exchanges have provided for (a) GSM on securities where such trading\nprice of such securities does not commensurate with financial health and fundamentals such as earnings, book value, fixed\nassets, net-worth, price per equity multiple and market capitalization; and (b) ASM on securities with surveillance concerns\nbased on objective parameters such as price and volume variation and volatility.\nOn listing, we may be subject to general market conditions which may include significant price and volume fluctuations. The\nprice of our Equity Shares may also fluctuate after the Offer due to several factors such as volatility in the Indian and global\nsecurities market, our profitability and performance, performance of our competitors, changes in the estimates of our\nperformance or any other political or economic factor. The occurrence of any of the abovementioned factors may trigger the\nparameters identified by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges for placing securities under the GSM or ASM framework such as net\nworth and net fixed assets of securities, high low variation in securities, client concentration and close to close price variation.\nIn the event our Equity Shares are covered under such pre-emptive surveillance measures implemented by SEBI and the Stock\nExchanges, we may be subject to certain additional restrictions in relation to trading of our Equity Shares such as limiting\ntrading frequency (for example, trading either allowed once in a week or a month) or freezing of price on upper side of trading\nwhich may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Equity Shares or may in general cause disruptions in the\ndevelopment of an active market for and trading of our Equity Shares.\n63.

Our Company did not have an internal audit system in place in Fiscal 2024 and we may therefore be subject to penalties\nfor such past non-compliance.\nOur Company was required to have an internal audit system in place by way of appointment of an internal auditor as per Section\n138 of the Companies Act. However, we were not compliant with this requirement in Fiscal 2024. We have appointed an\ninternal auditor for our Company as required under the Companies Act, 2013 for Fiscal 2025. While we have not received any\nnotice or penalty from the ministry of corporate affairs for our non-compliance in this regard till date, there can be no assurance\nthat we will not be subject to any penalty for such past non-compliance.\n44. We will not receive any proceeds from the Offer for Sale.\nThe Offer consists of a Fresh Issue of up to [●] Equity Shares of face value of ₹1 each aggregating up to ₹4,682.21 million and\nan Offer for Sale by the Selling Shareholders of up to 58,399,085 Equity Shares of face value of ₹1 each aggregating up to [●]\nmillion. The Selling Shareholders, shall be entitled to the net proceeds from the Offer for Sale, which comprise proceeds from\nthe Offer for Sale net of Offer expenses for the share of the Offer for Sale, and our Company will not receive any proceeds from\nthe Offer for Sale. For further information, see “The Offer” and “Objects of the Offer – Offer for Sale ” on pages 67 and 111\nrespectively.\n45. Certain sections of this Draft Red Herring Prospectus disclose information from the Redseer Report which is a paid\nreport and commissioned and paid for by us exclusively in connection with the Offer and any reliance on such\ninformation for making an investment decision in the Offer is subject to inherent risks.\nWe have availed the services of an independent consulting company, Redseer Strategy Consultants Private Limited\n(“Redseer”), appointed by our Company pursuant to an engagement letter dated February 13, 2025 to prepare an industry report\ntitled “Building India’s Home Story: Opportunity Landscape in Mattresses, Furniture, and Furnishings & Decor” dated June\n26, 2025, for purposes of inclusion of such information in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus to understand the industry in which\nwe operate. The Redseer Report has been commissioned by our Company exclusively in connection with the Offer for a fee.\nOur Company, Promoters, Directors, Key Managerial Personnel Senior Management Personnel and Book Running Lead\nManagers are not related to Redseer. This Redseer Report is subject to various limitations and based upon certain assumptions\nthat are subjective in nature. Further the commissioned report is not a recommendation to invest or divest in our Company.\nProspective investors are advised not to unduly rely on the commissioned report or extracts thereof as included in this Draft\nRed Herring Prospectus, when making their investment decisions.\n46. Internal or external fraud or misconduct by our employees could adversely affect our reputation and our results of\noperations.\nWe may be subject to instances of fraud, misappropriation, unauthorised acts and misconduct by our representatives and\nemployees which may go unnoticed for certain periods of time before corrective action is taken. Fraudulent and unauthorised\nconduct by our employees could also bind us to transactions that exceed the scope of authorisation and present significant risks\nto us. As a result, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, brand and reputational damage or financial harm. It is not always\npossible to deter fraud or misconduct by employees and the precautions we take and the systems we have put in place to prevent\nand deter such activities may not be effective in all cases. Further, we employ third parties for certain operations and\naccordingly, we are exposed to the risk of theft and embezzlement. In addition, we may be subject to regulatory or other\nproceedings in connection with such acts by our employees, which could adversely affect our goodwill. Even if we identify\ninstances of fraud, misappropriation, unauthorised acts and misconduct by our representatives and employees and pursue legal\nrecourse or file claims, we cannot assure you that we will recover any amounts lost through such instances of fraud,\nmisappropriation, unauthorised acts and misconduct by our representatives and employees. In the past, we have faced an\ninstance of an unauthorized attempt to remove products from our warehouse by some of our ex-employees from the warehouse\noperated by the Company in Howrah, Kolkata. In this regard, we have lodged an FIR with the concerned police station and the\nmatter is currently pending before the High Court of Calcutta. Further, in the past, we have faced another instance of cheating\nand criminal breach of trust against our Company by our employee pursuant to which we have lodged an FIR before the\nKankarbagh police station, Patna, Bihar.

However, no assurance\ncan be given that our Company will or will not be considered a PFIC in the current or future years. The determination of whether\nor not our Company is a PFIC is a factual determination that is made annually after the end of each taxable year, and there can\nbe no assurance that our Company will not be considered a PFIC in the current taxable year or any future taxable year because,\namong other reasons, (i) the composition of our Company’s income and assets will vary over time, (ii) our Company will hold,\nand may continue to hold, a substantial amount of cash following this offering and (iii) the manner of the application of relevant\nrules is uncertain in several respects. Further, our Company’s PFIC status may depend on the market price of its Equity Shares,\nwhich may fluctuate considerably.\n69. Compliance with provisions of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may affect payments on the Equity Shares.\nThe U.S. “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act” (or “FATCA”) imposes a new reporting regime and potentially, imposes a\n30% withholding tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” made by certain non-U.S. financial institutions (including\nintermediaries).\nIf payments on the Equity Shares are made by such non-U.S. financial institutions (including intermediaries), this withholding\nmay be imposed on such payments if made to any non-U.S. financial institution (including an intermediary) that is not otherwise\nexempt from FATCA or other holders who do not provide sufficient identifying information to the payer, to the extent such\npayments are considered “foreign passthru payments”. Under current guidance, the term “foreign passthru payment” is not\ndefined and it is therefore not clear whether and to what extent payments on the Equity Shares would be considered “foreign\npassthru payments”. The United States has entered into intergovernmental agreements with many jurisdictions (including India)\nthat modify the FATCA withholding regime described above. It is not yet clear how the intergovernmental agreements between\nthe United States and these jurisdictions will address “foreign passthru payments” and whether such agreements will require us\nor other financial institutions to withhold or report on payments on the Equity Shares to the extent they are treated as “foreign\npassthru payments”. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of FATCA, or any\nintergovernmental agreement or non-U.S. legislation implementing FATCA, to their investment in Equity Shares.\n70. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and foreign currencies may have an adverse effect on the\nvalue of the Equity Shares, independent of our operating results.\nUpon listing, the Equity Shares will be quoted in Indian Rupees on the Stock Exchanges. Any dividends in respect of the Equity\nShares will be paid in Indian Rupees and subsequently converted into appropriate foreign currency for repatriation. In addition,\nany adverse movement in exchange rates during a delay in repatriating the proceeds from a sale of Equity Shares outside India,\nfor example, because of a delay in regulatory approvals that may be required for the sale of Equity Shares, may reduce the net\nproceeds received by shareholders.\n71. QIBs and Non-Institutional Bidders are not permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity of Equity\nShares or the Bid Amount) at any stage after the submission of their Bid, and Retail Individual Bidders, and Eligible\nEmployees Bidding the Employee Reservation Portion are not permitted to withdraw their Bids after closure of the Bid/\nOffer Closing Date.\nPursuant to the SEBI ICDR Regulations, QIBs and NIBs are required to pay the Bid Amount on submission of the Bid and are\nnot permitted to withdraw or lower their Bids (in terms of quantity of Equity Shares or the Bid Amount) at any stage after\nsubmitting a Bid. Retail Individual Bidders and Eligible Employees Bidding the Employee Reservation Portion can revise their\nBids during the Bid/ Offer Period and withdraw their Bids until the Bid/ Offer Closing Date. While we are required to complete\nall necessary formalities for listing and commencement of trading of the Equity Shares on all Stock Exchanges where such\nEquity Shares are proposed to be listed, including Allotment, within three Working Days from the Bid/ Offer Closing Date or\nsuch other period as may be prescribed by the SEBI, events affecting the investors’ decision to invest in the Equity Shares,\nincluding adverse changes in international or national monetary policy, financial, political or economic conditions, our business,\nresults of operations, cash flows or financial condition may arise between the date of submission of the Bid and Allotment. We\nmay complete the Allotment of the Equity Shares even if such events occur, and such events may limit the Investors’ ability to\nsell the Equity Shares Allotted pursuant to the Offer or cause the trading price of the Equity Shares to decline on listing.\n72. Investors may be restricted in their ability to exercise pre-emptive rights under Indian law and thereby may suffer\nfuture dilution of their ownership position.\nUnder the Companies Act, 2013, a company having share capital and incorporated in India must offer its holders of equity\nshares pre-emptive rights to subscribe and pay for a proportionate number of shares to maintain their existing ownership\npercentages before the issuance of any new equity shares, unless the pre-emptive rights have been waived by adoption of a\nspecial resolution by holders of three-fourths of the equity shares voting on such resolution.\nHowever, if the law of the jurisdiction the investors are in, does not permit them to exercise their pre-emptive rights without\n65",

In the absence of any substantial precedents on the subject, the application of these provisions is subjective. If the\nGAAR provisions are made applicable to us, it may have an adverse tax impact on us. Further, if the tax costs associated with\ncertain of our transactions are greater than anticipated because of a particular tax risk materializing on account of new tax\nregulations and policies, it could affect our profitability from such transactions. The Union Finance Minister recently announced\nthe Income Tax Bill, 2025 (“IT Bill”) on February 13, 2025, which seeks to simplify the language and restructuring of\nprovisions of the existing Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”). The IT Bill is proposed to be enacted and come into\nforce on April 1, 2026.\nEarlier, distribution of dividends by a domestic company was subject to Dividend Distribution Tax (“DDT”), in the hands of\nthe company at an effective rate of 20.56% (inclusive of applicable surcharge and cess). Such dividends were generally exempt\nfrom tax in the hands of the shareholders. However, the GoI has amended the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”) to\nabolish the DDT regime. Accordingly, any dividend distribution by a domestic company is subject to tax in the hands of the\ninvestor at the applicable rate. Additionally, the Company is required to withhold tax on such dividends distributed at the\napplicable rate.\nThe Government of India announced the union budget for Fiscal 2026, following which the Finance Bill, 2025 (“Finance Bill”)\nwas introduced in the Lok Sabha on February 1, 2025. The Finance Bill will be enacted on April 1, 2025. Investors are advised\nto consult their own tax advisors and to carefully consider the potential tax consequences of owning, investing or trading in the\nEquity Shares. There is no certainty on the impact that the Finance Act may have on our business and operations or on the\nindustry in which we operate. Uncertainty in the applicability, interpretation or implementation of any amendment to, or change\nin, governing law, regulation or policy, including by reason of an absence, or a limited body, of administrative or judicial\nprecedent may be time consuming as well as costly for us to resolve and may affect the viability of our current business or\nrestrict our ability to grow our business in the future.\nWe cannot predict whether any new tax laws or regulations impacting our services will be enacted, what the nature and impact\nof the specific terms of any such laws or regulations will be or whether if at all, any laws or regulations would have an adverse\neffect on our business. Further, any adverse order passed by the appellate authorities/ tribunals/ courts would have an effect on\nour profitability. In addition, we are subject to tax related inquiries and claims.\n60. If inflation were to rise in India, we might not be able to increase the prices of our products at a proportional rate in\norder to pass costs on to our consumers thereby reducing our margins.\nInflation rates in India have been volatile in recent years, and such volatility may continue in the future. India has experienced\nhigh inflation in the recent past. Increased inflation can contribute to an increase in interest rates and increased costs to our\nbusiness, including increased costs of wages and other expenses. High fluctuations in inflation rates may make it more difficult\nfor us to accurately estimate or control our costs. Any increase in inflation in India can increase our expenses, which we may\nnot be able to adequately pass on to our consumers, whether entirely or in part, and may adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, cash flows and financial condition. In particular, we might not be able to reduce our costs or increase the price\nof our products to pass the increase in costs on to our consumers. In such case, our business, results of operations, cash flows\nand financial condition may be adversely affected. Further, the Government of India has previously initiated economic measures\nto combat high inflation rates, and it is unclear whether these measures will remain in effect. There can be no assurance that\nIndian inflation levels will not worsen in the future.

We could\nalso be required to pay interest at the applicable rates if allotment is not made, refund orders are not dispatched or demat credits\nare not made to investors within the prescribed time periods.\n66. Any future issuance of Equity Shares, or convertible securities or other equity linked instruments by us may dilute your\nshareholding and sale of Equity Shares by shareholders with significant shareholding may adversely affect the trading\nprice of the Equity Shares.\nWe may be required to finance our growth through future equity offerings. Any future equity issuances by us, including a\nprimary offering of Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to Equity Shares, may lead to the dilution of\ninvestors’ shareholdings in our Company. Any future equity issuances by us or sales of our Equity Shares by our shareholders\nmay adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares, which may lead to other adverse consequences including difficulty\nin raising capital through offering of our Equity Shares or incurring additional debt. Any disposal of Equity Shares by our major\nshareholders or the perception that such issuance or sales may occur, including to comply with the minimum public shareholding\nnorms applicable to listed companies in India may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares, which may lead to\nother adverse consequences including difficulty in raising capital through offering of the Equity Shares or incurring additional\ndebt. There can be no assurance that we will not issue Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to Equity Shares\nor that our Shareholders will not dispose of, pledge or encumber their Equity Shares in the future. Any future issuances could\nalso dilute the value of your investment in the Equity Shares. In addition, any perception by investors that such issuances or\nsales might occur may also affect the market price of our Equity Shares.\n67. Under Indian law, foreign investors are subject to investment restrictions that limit our ability to attract foreign\ninvestors, which may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares.\nUnder foreign exchange regulations currently in force in India, transfer of shares between non-residents and residents are freely\npermitted (subject to compliance with sectoral norms and certain other restrictions), if they comply with the pricing guidelines\nand reporting requirements specified by the RBI. If the transfer of shares, which are sought to be transferred, is not in compliance\nwith such pricing guidelines or reporting requirements or falls under any of the exceptions referred to above, then a prior\napproval of the RBI will be required. Further, unless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in all sectors\nof the Indian economy up to any extent and without any prior approvals, but the foreign investor is required to follow certain\nprescribed procedures for making such investment.\nAdditionally, shareholders who seek to convert Rupee proceeds from a sale of shares in India into foreign currency and\nrepatriate that foreign currency from India require a no-objection or a tax clearance certificate from the Indian income tax\nauthorities. As provided in the foreign exchange controls currently in effect in India, the RBI has provided that the price at\nwhich the Equity Shares are transferred be calculated in accordance with internationally accepted pricing methodology for the\nvaluation of shares at an arm’s length basis, and a higher (or lower, as applicable) price per share may not be permitted. We\ncannot assure investors that any required approval from the RBI or any other Indian government agency can be obtained on any\nparticular terms, or at all. Further, due to possible delays in obtaining requisite approvals, investors in the Equity Shares may\nbe prevented from realizing gains during periods of price increase or limiting losses during periods of price decline. In addition,\npursuant to the Press Note No. 3 (2020 Series), dated April 17, 2020, issued by the DPIIT, which has been incorporated as the\nproviso to Rule 6(a) of the FEMA Non-debt Rules, all investments under the foreign direct investment route by entities of a\ncountry which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of the Equity Shares is situated in or is a citizen of\nany such country, can only be made through the Government approval route, as prescribed in the Consolidated FDI Policy dated\nOctober 15, 2020 and the FEMA Rules. While the term “beneficial owner” is defined under the Prevention of Money-\nLaundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 and the General Financial Rules, 2017, neither the foreign direct investment\npolicy nor the FEMA Rules provide a definition of the term “beneficial owner”. The interpretation of “beneficial owner” and\nenforcement of this regulatory change involves certain uncertainties, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to raise\nforeign capital. Further, in the event of transfer of ownership of any existing or future foreign direct investment in an entity in\nIndia, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the aforesaid restriction/purview, such\nsubsequent change in the beneficial ownership will also require approval of the Government of India. These investment\nrestrictions shall also apply to subscribers of offshore derivative instruments. Additionally, there is uncertainty regarding the\ntimeline within which the said approval from the GoI may be obtained, if at all.\nFor further information, see “Restrictions on Foreign Ownership of Indian Securities” on page 421.\n68. U.S. holders should consider the impact of the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules in connection with\nan investment in our Equity Shares.\nA non-U.S. corporation will be a PFIC if either (i) 75% or more of its gross income is passive income or (ii) 50% or more of\nthe total value of its assets is attributable to assets, including cash, that produce or are held for the production of passive income.\nOur Company will be treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets and earning its proportionate share of the income\nof any other corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (by value) of the stock.\n64",

Investors may be subject to Indian taxes arising out of income arising on the sale of the Equity Shares.\nUnder current Indian tax laws, unless specifically exempted, capital gains arising from the sale of equity shares in an Indian\ncompany is generally taxable in India. A securities transaction tax (“STT”) is levied both at the time of transfer and acquisition\nof the equity shares (unless exempted under a prescribed notification), and the STT is collected by an Indian stock exchange on\nwhich the equity shares are sold. Any capital gain realized on the sale of listed equity shares on a recognised stock exchange\nheld for more than 12 months immediately preceding the date of transfer will be subject to long term capital gains in India at\nthe specified rates depending on certain factors, such as whether the sale is undertaken on or off the recognised stock exchanges,\nthe quantum of gains, and any available treaty relief.\nThe Government of India announced the union budget for Financial Year 2025-2026, following which the Finance Bill, 2025\n(“Finance Bill”) was introduced in the Lok Sabha on February 1, 2025. Subsequently, the Finance Bill received the assent from\nthe President of India and became the Finance Act, 2025, with effect from April 1, 2025 as amended by the Finance Act (No.2),\n(“Finance Act”). As per the Finance Act, in case of domestic company, the rate of income-tax shall be 25% of the total income,\nif the total turnover or gross receipts of the previous year 2023-24 does not exceed ₹ 400 crores and where the companies\ncontinue in Section 115BA regime. In all other cases the rate of income-tax shall be 30% of the total income. However, domestic\ncompanies also have an option to opt for taxation under section 115BAA of the Act on fulfilment of conditions contained\ntherein. The rate of income-tax rate is 22% under section 115BAA, having a surcharge at 10% on such tax. Investors are advised\nto consult their own tax advisors and to carefully consider the potential tax consequences of owning, investing or trading in the\nEquity Shares.\nFor tax deduction on securities, the Finance Act increases the limit in relation to the amount or the aggregate of amounts of\nincome by way of interest on securities from ₹ 5,000 to ₹ 10,000. With regard to the requirement of no tax being liable to be\ndeducted on dividend, the Finance Act has increased limit on amount of dividend earned from ₹ 5,000 to ₹ 10,000.\nThe Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”) was amended to provide domestic companies an option to pay corporate\nincome tax at the effective rate of 25.17% (inclusive of applicable surcharge and health and education cess), as compared to an\neffective rate of 34.94% (inclusive of applicable surcharge and health and education cess), provided such companies do not\nclaim certain specified deductions or exemptions. Further, where a company has opted to pay the reduced corporate tax rate,\nthe minimum alternate tax provisions would not be applicable. Any such future amendments may affect our ability to claim\nexemptions that we have historically benefited from, and such exemptions may no longer be available to us. Additionally, the\nUnion Cabinet, Government of India has recently approved the Income Tax Bill, 2025 which inter alia, proposes to amend the\nincome tax regime and replace the Income Tax Act, 1961. There is no certainty on the impact of the Income Tax Bill, 2025,\nonce enacted, on tax laws or other regulations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations or on the industry in which we operate.\nIn the past, the distribution of dividends by a domestic company was subject to Dividend Distribution Tax (“DDT”), in the\nhands of the company at an effective rate of 20.56% (inclusive of applicable surcharge and cess). Such dividends were generally\nexempt from tax in the hands of the shareholders. However, under the Finance Act 2020, any dividends paid by an Indian\ncompany will be subject to tax in the hands of the shareholders at applicable rates. Such taxes will be withheld by the Indian\ncompany paying dividends. Further, the Finance Act, 2021, which followed, removed the requirement for DDT to be payable\nin respect of dividends declared, distributed or paid by a domestic company after March 31, 2020, and accordingly, such\ndividends would not be exempt in the hands of the shareholders, both resident as well as non-resident. Non-resident shareholders\nmay claim benefit of the applicable tax treaty, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. Our Company may or may not grant\nthe benefit of a tax treaty (where applicable) to a non-resident Shareholder for the purposes of deducting tax at source pursuant\nto any corporate action, including dividends. Any business income realized from the transfer of Equity Shares held as trading\nassets is taxable at the applicable tax rates subject to any treaty relief, if applicable, to a non-resident seller.\nWe cannot predict whether any amendments made pursuant to the Finance Act would have an adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules and\nregulations, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations including foreign investment and stamp duty laws governing\nour business and operations could result in us being deemed to be in contravention of such laws and may require us to apply\nfor additional approvals.\n65. Investors will not be able to sell immediately on an Indian stock exchange any of the Equity Shares they purchase in\nthe Offer.\nThe Equity Shares will be listed on the Stock Exchanges. Pursuant to applicable Indian laws, certain actions must be completed\nbefore the Equity Shares can be listed and trading in the Equity Shares may commence. The Allotment and transfer of Equity\nShares in this Offer and the credit of such Equity Shares to the applicant’s demat account within the timeline specified under\napplicable law. There could be a failure or delay in the listing of the Equity Shares on the Stock Exchanges. Any failure or\ndelay in obtaining the approval or otherwise any delay in commencing trading in the Equity Shares would restrict investors’\nability to dispose of their Equity Shares. There can be no assurance that the Equity Shares will be credited to investors’ demat\n63",

Ind AS\ndiffers in certain significant respects from Indian GAAP, IFRS, U.S. GAAP and other accounting principles with which\nprospective investors may be familiar in other countries. We have not attempted to quantify their impact of US GAAP or IFRS\non the financial data included in this Draft Red Herring Prospectus nor do we provide a reconciliation of our financial statements\nto those of US GAAP or IFRS. US GAAP and IFRS differ in significant respects from Ind AS. Prospective investors should\nreview the accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements, and consult their own professional advisers\nfor an understanding of the differences between these accounting principles and those with which they may be more familiar.\nAny reliance by persons not familiar with Indian accounting practices on the financial disclosures presented in this Draft Red\nHerring Prospectus should be limited accordingly.\n58. We may be affected by competition laws in India, the adverse application or interpretation of which could adversely\naffect our business.\nThe Competition Act, 2002, of India, as amended (“Competition Act”), regulates practices having an appreciable adverse\neffect on competition in the relevant market in India (“AAEC”). Under the Competition Act, any formal or informal\narrangement, understanding or action in concert, which causes or is likely to cause an AAEC is considered void and may result\nin the imposition of substantial penalties. Further, any agreement among competitors which directly or indirectly involves the\ndetermination of purchase or sale prices, limits or controls production, supply, markets, technical development, investment or\nthe provision of services or shares the market or source of production or provision of services in any manner, including by way\nof allocation of geographical area or number of consumers in the relevant market or directly or indirectly results in bid-rigging\nor collusive bidding is presumed to have an AAEC and is considered void. The Competition Act also prohibits abuse of a\ndominant position by any enterprise. If it is proved that the contravention committed by a company took place with the consent\nor connivance or is attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of such company,\nthat person shall be also guilty of the contravention and may be punished.\nFurther, the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) has extra-territorial powers and can investigate any agreements, abusive\nconduct or combination occurring outside India if such agreement, conduct or combination has an AAEC in India. However,\nthe impact of the provisions of the Competition Act on the agreements entered into by us cannot be predicted with certainty at\nthis stage. In the event we pursue an acquisition in the future, we may be affected, directly or indirectly, by the application or\ninterpretation of any provision of the Competition Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the CCI, or any adverse\npublicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the CCI or if any prohibition or substantial penalties are levied\nunder the Competition Act, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. The manner\nin which the Competition Act and the CCI affect the business environment in India may also adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023 (“Competition Amendment Act”) was recently notified. The Competition\nAmendment Act amends the Competition Act and give the CCI additional powers to prevent practices that harm competition\nand the interests of consumers. The Competition Amendment Act, inter alia, modifies the scope of certain factors used to\ndetermine AAEC, reduces the overall time limit for the assessment of combinations by the CCI from 210 days to 150 days and\nempowers the CCI to impose penalties based on the global turnover of entities, for anti-competitive agreements and abuse of\ndominant position. The Competition Amendment Act also proposed amendments such as introduction of deal value thresholds\nfor assessing whether a merger or acquisition qualifies as a “combination,” expedited merger review timelines, codification of\nthe lowest standard of “control” and enhanced penalties for failing to provide material information.\nIf we pursue acquisition transactions in the future, we may be affected, directly or indirectly, by the application or interpretation\nof any provision of the Competition Act, any enforcement proceedings initiated by the CCI, any adverse publicity that may be\ngenerated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the CCI, any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution\nby the CCI, or any prohibition or substantial penalties levied under the Competition Act, which would adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of our operations, cash flows and prospects.\n59. The Indian tax regime has undergone substantial changes which could adversely affect our business and the trading\nprice of the Equity Shares.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by any change in the extensive central\nand state tax regime in India as applicable to us and our business.\nAny change in Indian tax laws in a central or state level could have an effect on our operations. The GoI has implemented two\nmajor reforms in Indian tax laws, namely the Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), and provisions relating to general anti-\navoidance rules (“GAAR”). The indirect tax regime in India has undergone a complete overhaul. The indirect taxes on goods\nand services, such as central excise duty, service tax, central sales tax, state value added tax, surcharge and excise have been\nreplaced by GST with effect from July 1, 2017. The GST regime continues to be subject to amendments and its interpretation\nby the relevant regulatory authorities is constantly evolving. GAAR became effective from April 1, 2017.

Setting up of COCO – Regular Stores\nWe sell our products through a comprehensive omnichannel strategy that integrates both our own channels and external\nchannels, enabling us to reach customers in more than 700 districts across 28 states and 5 union territories. In the offline format,\nwe either sell all of our products through our COCO – Regular Stores which are owned and operated by us or we retail some\nof our products through MBOs wherein products of multiple brands are sold and the outlets are operated by third parties. In\naddition to the above, we also have an online presence through our website and other online marketplaces including e-commerce\nand quick commerce platforms which ensures easy access to our products for our customers. For further details, see Our\nBusiness on page 172. The first COCO – Regular Store of our Company was launched on March 11, 2022 in Lucknow, Uttar\nPradesh. Our COCO – Regular Stores have grown from one store as of March 31, 2022 to 98 COCO – Regular Stores as of\nDecember 31, 2024, which exclusively retail products under our ‘Wakefit’ brand. These outlets provide a controlled and\nbranded environment where customers can experience our products firsthand, and engage with our trained staff members, which\nwe believe fosters a deeper connection with our brand. Our COCO – Regular Stores are exclusively managed and operated by\nour Company and therefore all of the capital and operational costs involved in operating the COCO – Regular Stores are incurred\nexclusively by us through our internal accruals/ external borrowing from financial institutions.\nOur strategy for adding more COCO – Regular Stores is data-driven and focuses on identifying locations with higher business\npotential. We assess market demand, population density, and demographic trends to understand where our products have the\nbest potential. By analysing customer data, we pinpoint underserved areas that could benefit from our COCO – Regular Stores.\nWe also evaluate the competitive landscape to find locations with competition for ready catchment or where we can differentiate\nourselves. We also review the sales performance of our existing COCO – Regular Stores to identify successful patterns and\nreplicate them in new areas. This approach helps us reach more customers and boost sales.\nThe number of COCO – Regular Stores established by our Company in the last three Financial Years and the nine-month period\nended December 31, 2024 are as follows:\nParticulars As at and for the nine- As at and for the As at and for the As at and for the\nmonth period ended Financial Year Financial Year Financial Year\nDecember 31, 2024 2024 2023 2022\nNumber of COCO – Regular Stores 48 34 22 1\nopened/added during the relevant\nperiod*\nNumber of COCO – Regular Stores 6 1 0 0\nclosed during the relevant period*#\nNumber of COCO – Regular Stores 98 56 23 1\nopen as on the last day of each\nperiod/closing count of the COCO –\nRegular Stores*\nTotal capital expenditure incurred on the 216.30 96.53 43.61 2.24\nCOCO – Regular Stores opened (in ₹\nmillion) *\nTotal area of COCO – Regular Stores 337,208 181,289 70,176 2,562\nopened (square feet)*\nAverage size of COCO – Regular Stores 3,440.90 3,237.30 3,051.13 2,562.00\nopened (square feet)*\n*As certified by Manian & Rao, Chartered Accountants having firm registration number 001983S, pursuant to their certificate dated June 26, 2025.\n# Reason for closure of certain COCO – Regular Stores is due to low revenue generation and due to relocation of the COCO – Regular Stores to other locations\nwithin India.\nWe believe that there is an opportunity for growth in the markets in which we operate and in order to build on our expansion,\nwe plan to strategically increase our presence offline. Our COCO – Regular Stores offer customers a hands-on experience with\nour products, enhancing their understanding and trust in our brand. As of December 31, 2024, our COCO – Regular Store’s\nsize ranges between 1,361 square feet to 8,867 square feet, with the average store size of 3,440.90 square feet.

Additionally, social media is emerging as a key commerce driver, enabling\ninfluencer-led shopping, social commerce, and deeper consumer engagement in digital retail.\nAs these factors converge, India’s digital consumer base is poised for sustained growth, with businesses\nincreasingly leveraging digital-first strategies to tap into a connected, aspirational, and convenience-driven\naudience.\nBranded retail is on the rise with the rapid proliferation of Direct to Consumer (“D2C”) players\nIndia’s retail sector is undergoing a structural transformation, with the share of branded and organized retail\nsteadily increasing as modern retail formats expand their reach. Consumers are becoming more brand-conscious,\ndriving demand for trusted, quality-assured products across categories and price segments.\nThis shift in consumer behaviour towards digital transactions and preference for branded products has led to a\nrapid influx of D2C players that caters to different consumer segments. The D2C model offers several advantages\nover traditional retail, including seamless access to products, the ability to browse and purchase from anywhere,\ndirect engagement with brands, personalized shopping experiences, and faster product innovation based on real-\ntime consumer insights.\nUrban consumers are increasingly seeking premium, personalized, and niche products, and curated shopping\nexperiences. Gen Z, in particular, values sustainability, individuality, and ethical consumption, pushing players to\ninnovate with unique offerings. At the same time, there is a parallel shift towards masstige products, which is\nserving the affordability segment with aspirational quality, accelerating the transition from unbranded to branded\nconsumption. Unlike traditional retail models, D2C players leverage digital platforms, data analytics, and direct\nconsumer engagement to differentiate themselves and scale rapidly. Moreover, by bypassing intermediaries, they\ncan pass on cost savings to consumers, making their offerings more price competitive, and parallelly reinvest in\nbetter customer experience, personalization and innovation.\nBy bypassing intermediaries, D2C players offer competitive pricing while reinvesting in experience and\ninnovation.

Channel choice often depends on category with commoditized or replenishment-\nbased items (e.g., packaged goods, apparel basics) tending to sell online, whereas high-involvement or sensory-\nled categories (e.g., furniture, beauty, premium electronics) relying on offline touchpoints for evaluation.\nThe evolving consumer journey in India reflects a growing preference for flexibility and convenience, with\nconsumers seamlessly navigating online and offline channels. Consumers are increasingly browsing online\nfollowed by store visits for hands-on evaluation before completing purchases. The purchase can either be online\nor offline based on convenience, price, or availability. This flexibility between digital and physical channels\nreflects a growing need for presence across channels, with consumers expecting seamless transitions across\ntouchpoints.\nCurrently, there are players present in both offline and online channels. Multi-channel retail players are present\nacross multiple independent channels like websites, marketplaces, social media, and physical stores. However,\nsince these channels function separately, they often lead to inconsistent customer experiences, pricing\ndiscrepancies, and fragmented inventory management, which can create inefficiencies and limit seamless\nengagement. On the other hand, a well-integrated omnichannel approach addresses these gaps by bridging\ndiscovery and experience, ensuring online platforms drive awareness while offline stores reinforce confidence\nand service. By synchronizing inventory, pricing, and customer interactions across all touchpoints, omnichannel\nretail enhances customer convenience, boosts retention, and fosters higher brand loyalty. Retailers who effectively\nblend these channels will drive stronger engagement, improved conversions, and a more cohesive shopping\nexperience in India’s evolving retail landscape.\nWith India’s sustained economic growth, rising affluence, and evolving consumer behaviour, the retail sector is\nset for rapid expansion. The combination of higher disposable incomes, urban lifestyle aspirations, and expanding\ndigital access will further accelerate demand for well-designed, branded products.

            "page_content": "The home & furnishings industry is characterized by high barriers to entry such as significant capital requirements,\nthe need for specialized manufacturing capabilities, efficient logistics and established brand recognition. Some of\nthe challenges that persist in the home & furnishings industry are as listed below. Unlocking its potential requires\naddressing persistent structural issues:\n1. Supply chain and logistics challenges – Heavy reliance on unorganized suppliers and small-scale\nmanufacturers leads to inconsistent quality and fulfilment inefficiencies. The bulky nature of furniture\nand mattresses increases transportation, warehousing, and last-mile delivery costs, while storage\nconstraints add operational complexity. Reverse logistics is particularly costly due to high handling\nexpenses, transit damage risks, and repackaging challenges, making scaling operations difficult. This\nmakes it especially imperative for companies to maintain low minimum order quantities (“MOQs”),\nwithout manufacturing large batches, to reduce inventory risk.\n2. Price-sensitive consumers and weak brand loyalty – Purchases are largely price-driven with limited\nbrand stickiness, especially for high-value items with long replacement cycles. This restricts\npremiumization and heightens price-based competition.\n3. Material and resource constraints – Fluctuations in raw material costs (foam, wood, fabrics, and\nmetals) impact pricing and production. Dependence on imported premium materials adds supply chain\nvolatility, while a shortage of skilled artisans in furniture and décor makes scaling high-end, customized\nproducts challenging.\n4. Lack of product and pricing standardization – Inconsistent product specifications, assembly\nvariations, and post-purchase services lead to uneven consumer experiences. Furniture and décor are\nparticularly difficult to standardize due to material and finishing differences. Pricing remains non-\ntransparent, with inflated costs from multiple intermediaries reducing affordability and brand\ndifferentiation.\n5. Evolving design trends and short product cycles – The design-driven nature of furniture and décor\nrequires frequent updates to keep pace with changing consumer preferences. Rapid shifts in soft\nfurnishings trends and growing demand across multiple design philosophies, multifunctional, and\nsustainable furniture make inventory planning complex.\n6. Demand volatility and inventory management challenges – Seasonal demand spikes, particularly\nduring festivals and weddings, create supply chain pressures. Managing stock keeping units (“SKU”)\ncomplexity across categories is difficult, as overstocking leads to high carrying costs and stockouts result\nin lost sales. Effective multi-channel inventory planning and demand forecasting are essential for\nprofitability.\nSolving for these key challenges will enable incumbents and new entrants to develop a competitive edge and build\na sustainable business model.\nThe Mattress category accounts for approximately 5% share of home & furnishings by value, projected to\ngrow at a CAGR of 10% to 12% to ₹ 270 to 300 billion (U.S.$ 3.2 to 3.6 billion) by CY2030\nThe Indian mattress industry has evolved from traditional cotton and coir options to modern and advanced sleep\nsolutions. Prior to 2000, the market was largely unorganised and dominated by cotton and coir mattresses, offering\naffordability but limited comfort. The 2000s saw the rise of foam and spring mattresses, introducing better back\nsupport and durability. India is one of the most sleep deprived nations in Asia. Others include Japan, South Korea,\nMalaysia and Philippines. Lack of sleep, coupled with the growing awareness of the importance of sleep for\noverall health and well-being has increased significantly in India in recent years, driven by rising health\nconsciousness, urban lifestyles, and digital access to wellness information. As a result, between 2010 and 2020,\ninnovation has accelerated with hybrid and orthopaedic mattresses, combining materials like memory foam and\nlatex to enhance comfort and ergonomics. Organized players and D2C players have further driven this shift,\nmaking advanced mattresses more accessible and standardizing quality across the market.\nEvolution of mattresses\nIllustrative\n152",

Focus on comfort, functionality, and wellness – Consumers are prioritizing ergonomic and health-\nfocused designs, boosting demand for orthopaedic mattresses, ergonomic seating, and functionally\nenhanced furnishings. The rise of hybrid work culture is further supporting long-term growth in both\nhome-office setups and office furniture.\n3. Rise in consumption of organised players offerings – Consumers are increasingly opting for organized\nbrands and digital platforms, moving away from unbranded local alternatives in search of better quality,\nconsistency, and service. This shift is prompting brands to streamline processes, standardize SKUs, and\nimprove fulfilment and after-sales processes. At the same time, the growth of e-commerce, D2C, and\nomnichannel formats is making organized products more affordable and accessible, further accelerating\nformalization across the category.\n4.

Ultimately, the ability to innovate and\nintegrate effectively will distinguish the leaders, enabling them to capture emerging opportunities and drive\nsustained success in the evolving market environment.\nCompetitive Landscape of Home & Furnishings market in India\nIndia’s home & furnishings market is rapidly evolving, with D2C players outpacing the incumbents\nThe home & furnishings industry has progressed from a fragmented, offline-dominated market to a more\norganized, technology driven and omnichannel ecosystem. The space was traditionally dominated by local\ncarpenters and small-scale manufacturers. Custom-built furniture was more common due to the dearth and high\nprice of readymade options. This was followed by the rise of organized retail and branded furniture, offering\nstandardized designs and accessibility.\nThe e-commerce boom in the decade following 2010 disrupted traditional buying patterns, introducing online\nmarketplaces, which paved the way for direct-to-consumer (“D2C”) players post 2020. These players leveraged\ndigital platforms to offer affordable, design-led, and customizable solutions while bypassing traditional retail\nmargins. More recently, the industry has evolved to an omnichannel approach, blending digital and in-store\nexperiences for seamless shopping.\nEcosystem Evolution\nIllustrative\nSource(s): Redseer research\nThe home and furnishings segment includes full-stack players with presence across furniture, furnishings, and\ndécor; vertical specialists focused on a single category; and large-format retailers or marketplaces aggregating\nmultiple brands. Many of these are D2C brands, which directly engage with consumers and often lead in digital-\nfirst, category-focused innovation.\nSome of the key players in the D2C home & furnishings market are Wakefit Innovations Limited, Duroflex Private\nLimited (Sleepyhead), Comfort Grid Technologies Private Limited, Urban Ladder Home Décor Solutions Limited\nin no particular order of ranking.\nD2C players disrupting the market with innovative products and leveraging a full-stack model\nD2C players have redefined the home & furnishings market by integrating full-stack models that streamline\ndesign, manufacturing, and distribution. By owning the entire value chain, these players eliminate intermediaries,\nenabling faster product innovation, competitive pricing, and consistent quality. This level of control allows them\nto adapt quickly to evolving consumer preferences, ensuring shorter design-to-market cycles compared to\ntraditional players.\n166",

Since these categories are long-term investments and are high involvement\npurchases, buyers seek reliable players that offer consistent craftsmanship, service, and value. Factors like\nstandardized quality, transparent pricing, post-purchase support, and seamless shopping experiences play a crucial\nrole in building and retaining consumer trust. Without trust, players struggle to drive repeat purchases and long-\nterm loyalty in this category.\nFor example, Wakefit Innovations Limited was the first organized player in India to offer a 100-day free trial and\nreturn policy for mattresses. It also led the industry by being the first organized player in India to introduce the\n100% refund policy for mattresses. As per Forbes India Awards for D2C Disruptors in 2022, Wakefit Innovations\nLimited ranks first among D2C players with operations of over 5 years in the Home & Lifestyle category.\nA strong brand presence enables seamless omnichannel expansion by leveraging consumer trust and recognition.\nIt reduces customer acquisition costs (“CAC”) through organic traffic, repeat purchases, and referrals, minimizing\nreliance on performance marketing. This self-reinforcing cycle drives efficiency, sustained growth, and long-term\nprofitability.\nMulti-category expansion increases share of wallet by driving repeat purchases and deeper customer\nengagement, leveraging brand trust and supply chain efficiencies for cost-effective growth\nA brand with a loyal customer base and established trust can leverage organic cross-selling into complementary\ncategories, expanding share of wallet and sustaining growth. Since home & furnishings categories have long\nreplacement cycles, relying on a single product line limits repeat purchases. Expanding into adjacent categories,\nsuch as moving from mattresses to furniture such as beds, sofas, etc., and furnishing & décor products such as\npillows, bedsheets, and cushions helps build greater brand trust, enhances cross-selling opportunities, and\nstrengthens customer acquisition by offering a more comprehensive and cohesive value proposition. The furniture\nmarket is estimated at ₹ 1,800 to 2,000 billion (U.S.$ 22 to 24 billion) in CY2024, while furnishings & décor is\nvalued at ₹ 790 to 860 billion (U.S.$ 9.5 to 10.4 billion) in CY2024. Expanding into these categories unlocks\naccess to a larger market opportunity. For example, Wakefit Innovations Limited, which started out as a mattress\nplayer would only have an estimated addressable market of ₹ 145 to 160 billion (U.S.$ 1.7 to 1.9 billion) as of\nCY2024. But by expanding to the other complementary categories of furniture and furnishings & décor, it now\nhas an estimated addressable market of ₹ 2.8 to 3.0 trillion (U.S.$ 34 to 36 billion). This expansion creates\nsustained demand, strengthens customer retention, and increases lifetime value by capturing a greater share of\nconsumer spending.\nConsumers are increasingly seeking one-stop home solutions, preferring players that offer a cohesive experience\nacross multiple categories. An anchor category serves as an entry point, with category expansion unlocking a\nlarger total addressable market (“TAM”) and increasing share of wallet. By ensuring consistency in quality,\ndesign, and functionality, players can reduce switching behaviour, deepen customer engagement, and maximize\nspending per consumer.\nA multi-category strategy is also cost-efficient, as a fully stacked player can leverage existing supply chains,\nwarehousing, and logistics with minimal investment, or implement modular design principles to create product\nvariations efficiently. Expanding into closely related product lines reduces the cost of new category launches,\nimproves operational efficiency, and captures a larger share of wallet. Additionally, cross-selling to existing\ncustomers increases order values and reduces CAC, making marketing efforts more effective and sustainable.\nSustained growth in the home & furnishings industry hinges on efficiency, differentiation, wide design portfolio,\nand strategic expansion.

By combining competitive\npricing with in-store experience, they have built a well-executed omnichannel strategy, which is now essential for\nmeeting evolving consumer expectations more effectively than traditional players. By leveraging omnichannel\nintegration, D2C players have scaled offline faster while maintaining cost efficiencies and pricing advantages,\nenabling them competitive advantage over their traditional counterparts.\nD2C players that continue to be heavily reliant on online marketplaces face the risk of pricing pressures, seasonal\ndiscounting, elevated commission costs, and increased performance marketing spends required to stay competitive\nagainst similar brands.

Economic sensitivity, discretionary spending risks and supply chain challenges: Furniture,\nmattresses, and home decor are discretionary purchases, making them vulnerable to economic\nslowdowns. Additionally, inflation-driven increases in raw material costs (wood, steel, fabrics),\ngeopolitical issues or shortages can erode margins and cause production or delivery delays while making\nit challenging to maintain competitive pricing without affecting profitability.\n2. Regulatory and environmental compliance: Increasing environmental regulations on sourcing\nsustainable materials, waste management, and emissions impact operations. Compliance with product\nsafety, quality standards, and evolving government policies on deforestation and chemical usage in\nmanufacturing may add complexity and costs.\n3. Competition, price sensitivity and expansion risks: While the home & furnishings industry is\nwitnessing heightened competition and aggressive price wars, sustaining such tactics long-term requires\na strong D2C foundation, operational efficiency, or clear brand differentiation. As the industry matures\nand pricing pressures rise, players must focus on localized strategies and scalable efficiencies to sustain\ngrowth amidst varying regional consumer preferences.\n4. Supply chain and logistics challenges: The bulky nature of furniture results in high transportation costs,\nwarehousing challenges, and longer delivery timelines. Efficient last-mile delivery and post-purchase\nservices like assembly remain key operational hurdles.\n5. Limited repeat purchases and retention challenges: Mattresses and furniture have long replacement\ncycles, reducing repeat purchases and customer retention. Companies operating in single-category\nsegments face long-term sustainability challenges. To drive sustained revenue growth, businesses must\nfocus on continuous customer acquisition, effective cross-selling strategies, and strong brand\nengagement.\nConclusion\nIndia’s home & furnishings market is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by rising disposable incomes,\nurbanization, and a growing preference for organized, branded products. The market, valued at ₹ 2.9 to 3.2 trillion\n(U.S.$ 35 to 38 billion) in CY2024, is projected to expand at a CAGR of 11% to 13%, reaching ₹ 5.4 to 6.4 billion\n(U.S.$ 65 to 77 billion) by CY2030. This growth is further fuelled by increasing homeownership, evolving\nlifestyle aspirations, and a shift toward design-driven home solutions.\nMarket formalization is accelerating as branded players gain traction over unorganized local businesses, while\npremiumization is reshaping consumer preferences, with a stronger emphasis on quality, aesthetics, and durability.\n170\n\n[TABLES]\nFinancials or FY2022 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Financials for CY2022 | \nRevenue\nfrom\noperations\n(FY2022)\n(₹ million) | 6,325.87 | 78,060.00 | 1,25,228.00 | 28,655.70 | 10,773.00 | 893.41 | 723.09 | 4,012.69 | 7,19,976.617 | 4,08,459.60\nEBITDA\n(FY2022)\n(₹ million) | -749.22 | 15,560.00 | 8,650.70 | 3,149.00 | -4,654.00 | -2.28 | 141.87 | 482.49 | NA | 71,355.10",

We launched 3,070 and 2,333 SKUs across all our categories in Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal\n2024, respectively. We initially produce small batches of new products to assess market demand. This\napproach enables us to understand customer interest before scaling up production, reducing inventory risks.\nWe focus on setting new standards in design and engineering through our blend of creativity, technical expertise,\nand customer focus. Our comprehensive design process includes customer-centric design, market analysis, and\nthe use of advanced software tools. We also regularly review and study a wide range of design concepts from\nacross the world, which helps us identify and select distinctive styles across different product categories. Our team\nof product designers and engineers work closely to ensure our products are aesthetic, functional, durable, and\ncost-effective to manufacture.\nOver the years, we have introduced innovative products to set us apart in the market. For example, our\nadvanced sleep tech products, such as Regul8 and Track8 from the Zense range, showcase our dedication to\nenhancing sleep quality through technology. Regul8 is designed to regulate the temperature of the mattresses,\nfeaturing water-based active temperature regulators. Track8 is a non-wearable, contactless smart technology\nthat monitors sleep patterns and provides valuable insights to users, helping them understand their sleep\nhabits and make informed decisions to improve their overall sleep quality.\n3. Full-stack vertically integrated operations with differentiated processes and technical capabilities\nOur full-stack vertically integrated operations enable us to control every aspect of our operations, from\nconceptualizing, designing and engineering our products to manufacturing, distribution and providing\ncustomer experience and engagement. We believe that this approach enhances operational efficiency, builds\nbrand loyalty, and gives us a competitive edge.\n• Design, engineering, and manufacturing. We focus on tech-centric R&D, engineering, and prototyping. We\nuse computer-aided design (“CAD”) to create detailed and accurate product designs, and computer-aided\nmanufacturing (“CAM”) to control the machines that produce our products. We use tools for visualizing and\nconceptualizing products with precision. Every product is designed with functionality, dimensions, and\nergonomics in mind. We upload our product designs to the cloud, enabling access throughout the\nmanufacturing process. Any design changes made in the cloud are automatically recognized and applied by\nour linked machinery across all production facilities. This automated system reduces errors, eliminates\nmanual reconfiguration, boosts efficiency, and minimizes downtime.\n181",

Strategic expansion of COCO – Regular Stores and enhance sales on our website\nWe intend to continue expanding our retail network to enhance our market reach and improve customer\naccessibility, while also undertaking initiatives to further enhance sales on our website.\nOpening COCO – Jumbo Stores and additional COCO – Regular Stores\nWe opened our first COCO – Regular store in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh on March 11, 2022. Since then, we\nhave grown our COCO – Regular Stores from 1 as of March 31, 2022, to 98 as of December 31, 2024, located\nin 35 cities across 18 states and 2 union territories. In the nine months period ended December 31, 2024, the\naverage order value for our COCO – Regular Stores was 56.99% higher than the average order value for our\nwebsite. We intend to open additional COCO Stores in the following store formats tailored to the needs of\ndifferent markets:\n• Opening COCO – Jumbo Stores. We intend to strategically set up COCO – Jumbo Stores, each spanning\n50,000 to 200,000 square feet, to offer a comprehensive range of our products and provide a one-stop\nshopping experience. These stores will serve as regional hubs, attracting customers from a broader\ngeographic area, thereby driving increased footfall and higher sales volumes. These stores will offer a\nwide range of products, allowing customers to address their various home and furnishings shopping\nneeds in a single visit. Leveraging our extensive product portfolio across various price points, our\nCOCO – Jumbo Stores will provide a comprehensive shopping destination where customers can explore\nand visualize multiple design options for bedrooms, living rooms, and other home setups under one\nroof. We intend to open two COCO – Jumbo Stores in Bengaluru, Karnataka, of which, one is proposed\nto be funded through a portion of our Net Proceeds. For further details, see “Objects of the Offer –\nCapital expenditure to be incurred by our Company for setting up of 117 new COCO – Regular Stores\nand one COCO – Jumbo Store” on page 112. Further, we may integrate restaurant amenities into our\nCOCO – Jumbo Stores to enhance customer experience, thereby increasing visit duration, loyalty, and\nrevenue per visit, ultimately improving overall store performance.\n• Opening additional stores in existing COCO – Regular Store. We recognize that not all cities or clusters\nhave the potential to generate sufficient revenue to sustain the capital expenditure and operating\nexpenditure of a COCO – Jumbo Stores. Therefore, we intend to continue opening more COCO –\nRegular Stores in our existing format in locations where they are well-suited. The size, number and\nexact area of the COCO – Regular Stores may vary and depend on various factors such as type/format\nof the catchment area, availability of suitable locations, lease rentals, potential footfall, and competition\nwithin a given region or across regions. We intend to open COCO – Regular Stores of varied sizes,\ntailored to specific catchment areas for mattress, furniture and furnishings products. We also intend to\ntap into smaller cities and towns and underserved pockets of metropolitan cities in India. By opening\nstores in these locations, we aim to capture customers who are not converting due to the lack of a touch-\nand-feel experience in the home and furnishing business. For further details, see “Objects of the Offer\n– Capital expenditure to be incurred by our Company for setting up of 117 new COCO – Regular Stores\nand one COCO – Jumbo Store” on page 112.\nWe will leverage detailed insights on store location identification, demographic insights, foot traffic analysis,\nrevenue projections, and retail competition to implement our expansion plans. This data-driven approach\nwill enable us to ensure that our new COCO – Regular Stores are situated in high-visibility locations with\ncustomer potential.\nWe may also expand our retail stores through a franchise model which we believe will allow us to scale our\nfootprints.\nEnhance sales on our website\n189\n\n[TABLES]\nWe intend to continue expanding our retail network to enhance our market reach and improve customer |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \naccessibility, while also undertaking initiatives to further enhance sales on our website. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nOpening COCO – Jumbo Stores and additional COCO – Regular Stores |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \nWe opened our first |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | COCO – Regular |  |  | store in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh on March 11, 2022.

A modular safety system, including extinguishers and temperature-sensing mechanisms,\nis in place to enhance operational security. After curing, foam blocks are stored for an additional 48 hours. The blocks are\nstacked up to five levels high, with a storage capacity of 1,400 to 1,500 blocks at a time. The total curing and storage time of\n72 hours ensures optimal molecular bonding of the foam.\nCutting - Foam blocks are trimmed and sliced using specialized machinery.\nGluing - Foam layers are assembled and glued using water-based adhesives. A curing period of 60 to 70 minutes ensures\nbonding at a molecular level. The adhesive used is a water-based glue, (except in case of spring mattresses) which improves\nefficiency and reduces costs, when compared to hot melt glue.\nCustomization - Custom mattress orders are further trimmed and finalized during this stage to meet specific customer\nrequirements.\nRoll packing – Stitched inner liner and outer covers are applied to the mattress before roll packing.\nFurniture Manufacturing\nOur furniture manufacturing process combines advanced technology, craftsmanship, and sustainable practices to deliver quality\nproducts.

Material accounting policies (Continued)\n2.5 Revenue recognition (Continued)\n(ii) Other Operating revenue (Sale of scrap and others)\nRevenue from sale of scrap in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the transaction price.\nRevenue from contracts for sale of services is recognised when services are rendered at a point in time,\nand when the related costs are incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount (discounts and incentives), an estimate is\nmade for the amount of consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring\nthe goods/services to the customer and such discounts and incentives are estimated at contract inception\nand constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative\nrevenue recognized will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is\nsubsequently resolved. The rights of return give rise to variable consideration.\nCustomer loyalty points\nThe Company has a loyalty points programme, which allows customers to accumulate points that can be\nredeemed for subsequent purchase. The loyalty points give rise to a separate performance obligation as\nthey provide a material right to the customer.\nA portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty points awarded to customers based on relative\nstand-alone selling price and recognized as a contract liability until the points are redeemed. Revenue is\nrecognized upon redemption of points by the customer.\nWhen estimating the stand-alone selling price of the loyalty points, the likelihood that the customer will\nredeem the points is considered. Estimates of the points that will be redeemed on each reporting date are\nupdated and any adjustments to the contract liability balance is charged against revenue.\nContract balances:\nTrade receivables\nA trade receivable is recognized if an amount of consideration is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of\ntime is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets\nfor initial recognition and subsequent measurement of financial assets.\nContract assets\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer,\nwhere that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. If the Company performs by\ntransferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is\ndue, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are\nsubject to impairment assessment.\nContract liabilities\nA contract liability is recognized if a payment is received, or a payment is due (whichever is earlier) from\nthe customer before the Company transfers the related goods or services. Contract liabilities are\nrecognized as revenue when the Company performs under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related\ngoods or services to the customer).\n269",

In making this assessment, the Company considers:\n- contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;\n- terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable interest rate features;\n- prepayment and extension features; and\n- terms that limit the Company claim to cash flows from specified assets.\n(c) Subsequent measurement\nFinancial assets at FVTPL- Subsequently measured at fair value.

The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other\npayables, lease liabilities and borrowings.\nb) Subsequent measurement\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified\nas at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial\nrecognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including\nany interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss.\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nInterest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss\non derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.\n278",

The amortisation\nperiod and method used for amortisation are reviewed at each period end. All intangible assets are\nassessed for impairment whenever there is an indication for impairment that an intangible asset may be\nimpaired.\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from\nuse or disposal. Any gain or loss on disposal of an intangible asset is recognised in the restated statement\nof profit and loss.\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in\nthe specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated\ngoodwill and brands, is recognised in the restated statement of profit and loss.\nThe cost of intangible assets as at April 1, 2021, the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was determined\nwith reference to its carrying value recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of\ntransition to Ind AS.\n2.9 Measurement of Fair Values\nCertain accounting policies and disclosures of the Company require the measurement of fair values, for\nboth financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The Company has an established control framework\nwith respect to the measurement of fair values. The Company regularly reviews significant unobservable\ninputs and valuation adjustments. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy\nbased on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or\nliability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).\n- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable\ninputs).\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses observable market data as far\nas possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of\nthe fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of\nthe fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.\nThe Company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting\nperiod during which the change has occurred. (Refer note 38).\n2.10 Impairment\nNon- financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than\ndeferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication\nexists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.\n272",

The Company’s normal operating cycle is twelve months.\n2.5 Revenue recognition\nThe Company generates revenue from sale of products to the customers. Revenue is recognised when\ncontrol of goods and services is transferred to the customer upon the satisfaction of performance obligation\nunder the contract at a transaction price that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to\nbe entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

The performance obligation is completed upon delivery of products to the\ncustomer.\nRevenue is measured on the contract price net of any taxes collected from customers and variable\nconsideration on account of various discounts and schemes offered by the Company. The transaction\nprice is an amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring promised goods.\nFor contracts that permit the customer to return an item, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is\nhighly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur.\nTherefore, the amount of revenue recognised is adjusted for expected returns, which are estimated based\non the historical data. In these circumstances, a refund liability and a right to recover returned goods asset\nare recognised.\nThe refund liability, to the extent that the Company offers it in the form of a cash refund, is presented\nunder “Other current financial liabilities”. The refund liability offered in the form of a replacement or\nexchange of another good is presented under “Other current liabilities”.\n268",

Material accounting policies (Continued)\n2.10 Impairment (Continued)\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e., the higher of the fair value less cost\nto sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate\ncash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount\nis determined for the cash generating unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs. Value in use is based on\nthe estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflect\ncurrent market assessments of time value of money and the risk specific to the CGU.\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the restated statement of profit and loss and is measured by the\namount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset.\nAn impairment loss is reversed in the restated statement of profit and loss if there has been a change in\nthe estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to\nits revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that\nwould have been determined (net of any accumulated amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment\nloss been recognized for the asset in prior periods/ years.\nFinancial assets\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement\nand recognition of impairment loss. The Company follows 'simplified approach' for recognition of\nimpairment loss allowance on trade receivables.\nThe Company considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n• the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full; or\n• the ageing is more than 12 months past due.\nThe application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk.\nRather, it recognizes impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from\nits initial recognition.\nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets i.e., investments, bank balances/deposits, etc.,\nand risk exposure, the Company determines whether there has been a significant increase in the credit\nrisk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide\nfor impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used.\nIf in subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant\nincrease in credit risk since initial recognition, then the Company reverts to recognizing impairment loss\nallowance based on 12-month ECL.\nECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with\nthe contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive (i.e., all shortfalls), discounted at\nthe original EIR.\nThe Company recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets recorded at\namortised cost. At each reporting date the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised\ncost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is \"credit-impaired\" when one or more events that have a\ndetrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\n273",

Material accounting policies (Continued)\n2.20 Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity\nshareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The\nweighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for events such as\nbonus issue, bonus element in a rights issue to existing shareholders, share split and reverse share split\n(Consolidation of shares) that will change the number of equity shares outstanding, without a\ncorresponding change in resources.\nDiluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit/(loss) after tax as adjusted for dividend,\ninterest (net of any attributable taxes) other charges to expense or income relating to the dilutive potential\nequity shares, by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings\nper share and the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on the\nconversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\nPotential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only if their conversion to equity shares would decrease\nthe net profit per share or increase the net loss per share. Potential dilutive equity shares are deemed to be\nconverted as at the beginning of the period, unless they have been issued at a later date.\n2.21 Foreign currency translations\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the\ndates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such\ntransactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies\nat period/ year end exchange rates are recognised in the restated statement of profit and loss.\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using\nthe exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a\nforeign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.\nThe gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with\nthe recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on\nitems whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or\nprofit or loss, respectively).\n2.22 Operating segments\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief\noperating decision maker (CODM).\nThe Company's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Company is engaged in manufacture\nand sale of mattress, furniture and accessories and its principal geographical segment is India. The\nCompany’s operating businesses are organized and managed as a single operating segment.\nConsequently, the CODM believes that there are no reportable segments as required under Ind AS 108\n'Operating segments’\n283",

Material accounting policies (Continued)\n2.12 Financial Instruments (Continued)\nc) Derecognition\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or\nexpires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially\ndifferent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or\nmodification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.\nThe difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the restated statement of profit and loss.\nd) Offsetting\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when,\nand only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends\neither to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n2.13 Leases\nAt inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is,\nor contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of\ntime in exchange for consideration.\nTo assess where the Company has the right to control the use of identified assets, the Company assesses\nwhether the:\n(i) the contract involves the use of identified assets,\n(ii) whether the Company has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use\nof assets throughout the period of use and\n(iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of assets.\nCompany as a lessee\nThe Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The\nright-of-use (\"ROU\") asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease\nliability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct\ncosts incurred and an estimate of cost to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the\nunderlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement\ndate to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The\nright-of-use assets is periodically assessed for impairment.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the\nimplicit rate of interest or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company's incremental borrowing\nrate. Generally, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when\nthere is change in future lease payments arising from a change in index or rate, or if there is change in the\nCompany's estimate of amount expected to be payable under residual guaranteed value, or if the\nCompany changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n279",

Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue\nof equity instruments do not affect its classification.\nAll other liabilities are classified as non-current.\nThe operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents.\nThe Company’s normal operating cycle is twelve months.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company generates revenue from sale of products to the customers. Revenue is recognised when control of goods and\nservices is transferred to the customer upon the satisfaction of performance obligation under the contract at a transaction price\nthat reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In relation\nto revenue from contracts with customers, amounts are generally collected in advance.\n(i) Revenue from sale of products\nRevenue from the sale of products is recognised at a point in time when control of the product being sold is transferred to\nthe customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. The\nperformance obligation is completed upon delivery of products to the customer.\nRevenue is measured on the contract price net of any taxes collected from customers and variable consideration on account\nof various discounts and schemes offered by the Company. The transaction price is an amount of consideration to which\nthe Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods.\nFor contracts that permit the customer to return an item, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that\na significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. Therefore, the amount of revenue\nrecognised is adjusted for expected returns, which are estimated based on the historical data. In these circumstances, a\nrefund liability and a right to recover returned goods asset are recognised.\nThe refund liability, to the extent that the Company offers it in the form of a cash refund, is presented under “Other current\nfinancial liabilities”. The refund liability offered in the form of a replacement or exchange of another good is presented\nunder “Other current liabilities”.\n(ii) Other Operating revenue (Sale of scrap and others)\nRevenue from sale of scrap in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the transaction price.\n337",

The rights of return give rise to variable consideration.\nCustomer loyalty points\nThe Company has a loyalty points programme, which allows customers to accumulate points that can be redeemed for\nsubsequent purchase. The loyalty points give rise to a separate performance obligation as they provide a material right to the\ncustomer.\nA portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty points awarded to customers based on relative stand-alone selling\nprice and recognized as a contract liability until the points are redeemed. Revenue is recognized upon redemption of points by\nthe customer.\nWhen estimating the stand-alone selling price of the loyalty points, the likelihood that the customer will redeem the points is\nconsidered. Estimates of the points that will be redeemed on each reporting date are updated and any adjustments to the contract\nliability balance is charged against revenue.\nContract balances:\nTrade receivables\nA trade receivable is recognized if an amount of consideration is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required\nbefore payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets for initial recognition and\nsubsequent measurement of financial assets.\nContract assets\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer, where that right\nis conditioned on something other than the passage of time. If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to\na customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned\nconsideration that is conditional. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment.\nContract liabilities\nA contract liability is recognized if a payment is received, or a payment is due (whichever is earlier) from the customer\nbefore the Company transfers the related goods or services. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the\nCompany performs under the contract (i.e., transfers control of the related goods or services to the customer).\nOther Income\nInterest income:\nInterest income is recognized using the effective interest method or time proportion method, based on rates implicit in the\ntransaction.\nDividend income on investments is recognised in the restated statement of profit and loss when the Company’s right to\nreceive dividend is established.\nProfit on sale of mutual funds and fair value impact on mark-to-market contracts are recognised on transaction completion\nand or on reporting date as applicable.\nProperty, plant, and equipment\n(i) Recognition and measurement\nThe cost of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be recognised as an asset if, and only if it is probable that future\neconomic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n338",

The residual value,\nappropriateness of depreciation period and depreciation method is reviewed by the management each financial year, with\nthe effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\nIntangible assets and amortisation\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. An intangible asset is recognised only if it is probable that\nfuture economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\nAfter initial recognition, intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment cost, if any.\nAmortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. Computer software\nis amortized on a straight-line method over a period of three years. The amortisation period and method used for amortisation\nare reviewed at each period end. All intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication for impairment\nthat an intangible asset may be impaired.\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Any\ngain or loss on disposal of an intangible asset is recognised in the restated statement of profit and loss.\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to\nwhich it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in the\nrestated statement of profit and loss.\nThe cost of intangible assets as at April 1, 2021, the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, was determined with reference to\nits carrying value recognised as per the previous GAAP (deemed cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.\nMeasurement of Fair Values\nCertain accounting policies and disclosures of the Company require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-\nfinancial assets and liabilities. The Company has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair\nvalues. The Company regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. Fair values are categorized\ninto different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly\n(i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).\n- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses observable market data as far as possible. If the\ninputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair\nvalue measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the entire measurement.\nThe Company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which\nthe change has occurred. (Refer note 38).\nImpairment\nNon- financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than deferred tax assets) to\ndetermine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is\nestimated.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e., the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-\nin-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of\nthose from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (“CGU”) to which the\nasset belongs. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount\nrate that reflect current market assessments of time value of money and the risk specific to the CGU.\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the restated statement of profit and loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying\nvalue of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the restated\n340",

The carrying\namount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying\namount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been\nrecognized for the asset in prior periods/ years.\nFinancial assets\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of\nimpairment loss. The Company follows 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables.\nThe Company considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n• the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full; or\n• the ageing is more than 12 months past due.\nThe application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes\nimpairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.\nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets i.e., investments, bank balances/deposits, etc., and risk exposure,\nthe Company determines whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk\nhas not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased\nsignificantly, lifetime ECL is used.\nIf in subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk\nsince initial recognition, then the Company reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.\nECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and\nall the cash flows that the Company expects to receive (i.e., all shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR.\nThe Company recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets recorded at amortised cost. At each\nreporting date the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired. A financial\nasset is \"credit-impaired\" when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of\nthe financial asset have occurred.\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired included the following observable data:\n- significant financial difficulties of the borrower or issuer;\n- the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise; and\n- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when\nestimating ECLs, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without\nundue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Company’s\nhistorical experience and informed credit assessment, that includes forward-looking information.\nPresentation of allowance for ECL in the balance sheet\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.\nEmployee benefits\n(i) Short term employee benefits\nEmployee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving employee services are classified as short-term\nemployee benefits and are measured on undiscounted basis. These benefits include salaries and wages, bonus etc., which\nare to be paid in exchange for the employee services and are recognised as an expense in the restated statement of profit\nand loss in the period in which the employee renders the related service.\n(ii) Defined contribution plans\n341",

The Company recognises\nthe following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the restated statement of profit and loss:\n- Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine\nsettlements; and\n- Net interest expense or income\n(iv) Other long-term employee benefits- Compensated absences\nBenefits under the Company’s compensated absences constitute other long-term employee benefits, recognised as an\nexpense in the restated statement of profit and loss for the period in which the employee has rendered services. Estimated\nbenefits on account of these benefits is provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method\nat the period/year end. Remeasurements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\nThe Company presents the entire compensated absences balance as a current liability in the restated statement of assets and\nliabilities since, the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for twelve months after the\nreporting date.\n(v) Share based payments\nEmployees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services\nas consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions). The Company measures compensation cost relating\nto employee stock options plans using the fair valuation method in accordance with Ind AS 102 “Share-Based Payment”.\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using the Black\nScholes model and the cost is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in share based payment reserve in equity,\nover the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in a graded vesting manner. The cumulative\nexpense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which\nthe vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately\nvest.\nIn case of cancellation or settlement of grant of equity instruments during the vesting period (other than a grant cancelled\nby forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied), the Company shall account for the cancellation or settlement\nas an acceleration of vesting and shall therefore recognise immediately the amount that otherwise would have been\nrecognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period.\nAny payment made to the employee on the cancellation or settlement of the grant shall be accounted for as the repurchase\nof an equity interest, i.e., as a deduction from equity, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value of the\nequity instruments granted, measured at the repurchase date. Any such excess shall be recognised as an expense in the\nrestated statement of profit and loss.\n342",

If we are unable to generate adequate revenues from these new stores, the increased rent expenses\ncould strain our financials, potentially leading to lower profit margins or even losses.\nAvailability and cost of raw materials consumed\nA significant portion of our cost structure is attributed to the cost of materials consumed. Our ability to remain competitive and\nprofitable depends on our ability to source and maintain a stable and sufficient supply of raw materials at cost effective prices.\nOur primary raw materials include chemicals, natural and processed wood, fabrics, glue, and metals. The table below provides\nour cost of materials consumed, as a percentage of our total expenses, in relevant period/ years:\nParticulars December 31, 2024 Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nCost of materials consumed 4,468.88 4,639.71 4,717.11 3,800.26\n(in ₹ million)\nCost of materials consumed\nas a percentage of total 44.55% 44.94% 48.85% 51.11%\nexpenses (%)\nWe typically procure such materials through purchase orders and do not enter into any long-term agreements with our suppliers.\nIf we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of raw materials for our products in the required volumes and at\nappropriate quality and reliability levels from any of our suppliers, and we are unable to procure the raw materials from other\nsources at cost effective prices our sales, profit margins and customer relations would be adversely affected. Further, we are\nexposed to fluctuations in availability and prices of our raw materials and we may not be able to effectively pass on all increases\nin cost of raw materials to our customers, which may affect our margins and results of operations. The price of our raw materials\nmay fluctuate due to several reasons including market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, production and transportation costs\nand changes in domestic and international trade policies. Any inability on our part to procure sufficient quantities of raw\nmaterials and on commercially acceptable terms, could lead to a change in our manufacturing and sales volumes.\nCompetition\nThe home and furnishings industry in India is competitive, fragmented and largely unorganised. For further information, see\n“Risk Factors – The home and furnishings industry is competitive and our inability to compete effectively may adversely affect\nour business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows” and “Our Business – Competition” on pages 41 and\n213, respectively. Our products compete with local retailers, non-branded products and products of other established brands. In\nthe future, some of our competitors may develop alliances to compete against us, acquire greater resources, market presence\nand geographic reach, as well as develop products with better brand recognition than ours. Some of our competitors may be\nable to procure raw materials or finished products at lower costs than us, and consequently be able to sell their products at lower\nprices. As a result, our competitors may be able to withstand industry downturns better than us or sell their products at more\ncompetitive prices.\n335\n\n[TABLES]\nRevenue from our own channels\n(₹ million) | 5,319.64 | 5,750.60 | 4,672.55 | 3,758.20\nRevenue from our own channels\nas a percentage of revenue from\noperations | 54.78% | 58.30% | 57.50% | 59.41%\nOur COCO – Regular Stores also play a crucial role in our success.

The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, lease liabilities and\nborrowings.\nb) Subsequent measurement\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL\nif it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities\nat FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or\nloss.\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense\nand foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised\nin profit or loss.\nc) Derecognition\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an\nexisting financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an\nexisting liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original\nliability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the\nrestated statement of profit and loss.\nd) Offsetting\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when,\nthe Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net\nbasis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nLeases\nAt inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a\nlease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for\nconsideration.\nTo assess where the Company has the right to control the use of identified assets, the Company assesses whether the:\n(i) the contract involves the use of identified assets,\n(ii) whether the Company has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of assets\nthroughout the period of use and\n(iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of assets.\nCompany as a lessee\nThe Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use\n(\"ROU\") asset is initially measured at cost , which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease\npayments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of cost to\ndismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease\nincentives received.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier\nof the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets is periodically\nassessed for impairment.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the implicit rate of\ninterest or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company\nuses the incremental borrowing rate.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is change\nin future lease payments arising from a change in index or rate, or if there is change in the Company's estimate of amount\nexpected to be payable under residual guaranteed value, or if the Company changes it assessment whether it will exercise\na purchase, extension or termination option.\n345",

The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the restated\nfinancial information.\nContingent asset:\nContingent asset is not recognised in restated financial information since this may result in the recognition of income that\nmay never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent\nasset and is recognized.\nProvisions, contingent liabilities, and contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.\nWarranty\nThe estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using\nhistorical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding\npossible future incidence based on corrective actions on product failures.

The financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023, were the first set of financial statements prepared\nin accordance with Ind AS 101 - First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’). The date of transition was\nApril 01, 2021.\nFor the purpose of preparation of the Ind AS balance sheet as at April 01, 2021 and its presenting the comparative information\nfor the year ended March 31, 2022, the Company has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in\naccordance with previous GAAP. This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with previous GAAP and how the transition from previous GAAP to Ind AS has affected\nthe Company's financial position, financial performance and cash flows.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur Company is exposed to various financial risks majorly credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market risk.\nCredit Risk\n(i) Trade receivables\nCredit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading\nto a financial loss. Our credit risk with regards to receivables is reduced by our business model which allows it to have immediate\ncash collection. We predominantly deal with market places and online payment partners and these are short term and carry very\nlow credit risk at the reporting date. Our Company does not have significant risk exposure to any single counter party.\nWe review trade receivables on periodic basis and takes necessary mitigations, wherever required. We recognise loss allowance\nfor expected credit losses on trade receivables measured at amortised cost.\n(ii) Financial instruments and cash deposits\nCredit risk from balances with banks is managed by our treasury team. Investments of surplus funds are made primarily in\nmutual fund units and fixed deposits. Basis the assessment, we have not identified any expected credit loss on the financial\ninstruments and cash deposits. With respect to other financial assets including security deposits and advance to employees, we\nhave not identified any default in recovery of amounts basis the assessment of credit risk. Hence, we have no significant class\nof financial assets that is past due but not impaired.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet the payment obligations resulting from financial liabilities which may arise\nfrom unavailability of funds. Our financial planning has ensured, as far as possible, that there is sufficient liquidity to meet the\nliabilities whenever due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage\nto our reputation. We believe that cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, bank deposits and current investments are\nsufficient to meet its current requirements, accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived. We regularly monitor the rolling forecasts\nto ensure we have sufficient cash on an on-going basis to meet operational needs. Any short-term surplus cash generated, over\nand above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash and\ncash equivalents (to the extent required) and any excess is invested in interest bearing term deposits with appropriate maturities\nand in mutual funds to optimise the cash returns on investments while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in\nmarket prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange\nrates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes.\n(i) Currency risk\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate due to changes in foreign\nexchange rates. The functional currency of our Company is Indian Rupees and our revenue is generated predominantly from\noperations in India. We do not enter into any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n(ii) Price risk\n361",

While the\nIndustrial Policy, 1991 prescribes the limits and the conditions subject to which foreign investment can be made in different\nsectors of the Indian economy, FEMA regulates the precise manner in which such investment may be made. Under the Industrial\nPolicy, 1991 unless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in all sectors of the Indian economy up to any\nextent and without any prior approvals, but the foreign investor is required to follow certain prescribed procedures for making\nsuch investment. The RBI and the concerned ministries/departments are responsible for granting approval for foreign\ninvestment. The Government has from time to time made policy pronouncements on foreign direct investment (“FDI”) through\npress notes and press releases. The DPIIT, issued the Consolidated FDI Policy, which, with effect from October 15, 2020,\nconsolidated and superseded all previous press notes, press releases, circulars and clarifications on FDI issued by the DPIIT\nthat were in force and effect as on October 15, 2020. The Consolidated FDI Policy will be valid until the DPIIT issues an\nupdated circular. FDI in companies engaged in sectors/ activities which are not listed in the Consolidated FDI Policy is permitted\nup to 100% of the paid-up share capital of such company under the automatic route, subject to compliance with certain\nprescribed conditions. For further details, see “Key Regulations and Policies” on page 217.\nThe transfer of shares between an Indian resident and a non-resident does not require the prior approval of the RBI, provided\nthat (i) the activities of the investee company are under the automatic route under the FDI Policy and transfer does not attract\nthe provisions of the SEBI Takeover Regulations; (ii) the non-resident shareholding is within the sectoral limits under the FDI\nPolicy; and (iii) the pricing is in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the SEBI/ RBI.\nFurther, in accordance with Press Note No. 3 (2020 Series), dated April 17, 2020 issued by the DPIIT and the Foreign Exchange\nManagement (Non-debt Instruments) Amendment Rules, 2020 which came into effect from April 22, 2020, any investment,\nsubscription, purchase or sale of equity instruments by entities of a country which shares land border with India or where the\nbeneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country (“Restricted Investors”), will\nrequire prior approval of the Government, as prescribed in the Consolidated FDI Policy and the FEMA Non-debt Instruments\nRules.
