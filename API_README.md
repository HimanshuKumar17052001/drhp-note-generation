# DRHP IPO Notes Generation Tool - API Documentation

## Overview

The DRHP IPO Notes Generation Tool has been updated to provide a streamlined user experience where:

1. **All processed companies** are listed in the "View Companies" dropdown
2. **Quick report loading** - clicking on a company immediately loads and displays the final HTML report
3. **Real-time updates** - new companies are automatically added to the dropdown as they complete processing
4. **No processing status display** - the interface focuses on showing completed reports
